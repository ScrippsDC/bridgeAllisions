MARINER OPTED TO ENTER INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TO PROVE CURE.\n\n\n SUMMARY:\n \n Approximately 0040, 03FEB01, the M\/V SARA EXPRESS (O.N. L8912118), while being towed outbound the Miami River stern-first and deadship by the tugs ANNELIESE (O.N.  D240646) and JOSEPH A (O.N. D275040) allided with the northeast corner of the NW 5th ST bridge abutment and the bridge's opened north span.  The bridge sustained major damage to the pedestrian sidewalk, the north span's eastern-most girder, and its trunnion.  The SARA EXPRESS sustained damage to the upper starboard corner of the transom including a 5 inch hole in the side shell plating just below the weather deck, buckled bulwarks, and bent handrails.  The SARA EXPRESS also sustained damage to a 2 feet wide by 1 foot deep section of deck, the deck-edge combing, and handrails on the starboard, after side of the boat deck.  There were no injuries as a result of the incident.  \n \n FINDINGS OF FACT:\n \n 1. The SARA EXPRESS is a Panama flagged, 268 ft., 1597 GT, steel-hulled freighter built in 1989 (see encl 43).  The beam of the SARA EXPRESS is approximately 40 ft.  Her draft was 11 feet forward and 13 feet aft.\n \n 2. The JOSEPH A is a U.S. flagged, 60.3 ft., 55 GT, steel-hulled tug rated at 900 horsepower (see encl 45).  The JOSEPH A is operated by P & L Towing and Transportation, Inc.\n \n 3. The ANNELIESE is a U.S. flagged, 68 ft., 82 GT steel-hulled tug rated at 735 horsepower (see encl 44).  The ANNELIESE is also operated by P & L Towing and Transportation, Inc.\n \n 4. Mr. Edward Nolan was the master of the JOSEPH A.  Mr. Nolan holds a vaild CG license #875833 authorizing him to serve as master of vessels of not more than 100 GT upon near coastal waters (see encl 34).  Mr. Nolan had been working for P & L Towing for several years as master of the trail tug.\n \n 5. Mr. James Ratican was the master of the ANNELIESE.  Mr. Ratican holds a\n valid CG license #885620 authorizing him to serve as master of vessels of not more than 100 GT upon near coastal waters (see encl 33).  Mr. Ratican had been working for P & L Towing for several years.\n \n 6. The SARA EXPRESS transits the Miami River on a weekly basis and normally departs Miami every Friday evening at 2100.  P&L tugs have provided towing services for the SARA EXPRESS for several years.  Both tug operators have significant experience towing this vessel and were very knowledgeable about the vessel's handling characteristics.\n \n 7. The SARA EXPRESS was being towed stern-first and deadship out the Miami\n River in an easterly direction.  The ANNELIESE had two towing hawsers approximately 50 ft. long attached to the port stern and the starboard stern of the SARA EXPRESS and was responsible for towing the SARA EXPRESS down the\n river.  The JOSEPH A had two hawsers approximately 35 ft long attached to the port bow and the starboard bow of the SARA EXPRESS and was responsible for controlling the direction of movement of the SARA EXPRESS (see encl 6, diagram 1).  \n \n 8. P & L's standard procedure to conduct a deadship tow on the Miami River is\n to use two tugs.  The lead tug stays in the middle of the channel while constantly pulling the leading end of the tow.  The control, or trail tug,\n pulls the trailing end of the tow to one side or the other which moves the\n stern in that direction much like the reaction caused by placing a vessel's rudder over hard.  \"Pushing on the hawser\" is the commonly used term used to describe the hawser leading aft from the control tug's bow while pulling the tow's trailing end to one side or the other (see encl 6, diagram 3).  The control tug can also back down to slow the forward movement of the tow or to pull the stern back to one side or the other in preparation for a turn if there is enough room astern of the tug (see encl 6, diagram 4).  The lead tug can also assist with turns by pulling the tow's leading end in the direction of the turn, but this action is taken less frequently (see encl 6, diagram 3).  The pivot point of the towed vessel will vary depending on the forces the lead and trail tugs exert and which towing hawsers the forces are being exerted on.\n \n 9. Weather conditions at the time of the incident were clear, with good visibility.  The wind was light and variable.  The current was flooding at approx. one knot.  Low tide had occurred approx. 2300, 02FEB00.  Tides were noted to be 1-2 feet below the normally expected levels for that time of day.\n \n 10. Outbound, approaching the NW 5TH ST bridge, the Miami River runs approximately 110 degrees true.  Approximately 150 feet before the NW 5TH ST bridge, the river makes a 10 degree bend to the right.  At the the bridge, the effective channel bends another 10 degrees to the right due to the orientation of the bridge across the river. The river then beds back 20 degrees to the left approximately 150 feet past the NW 5TH ST bridge (see encl 5).\n \n 11. As noted on NOAA chart 11467, the controlling depth of the Miami River is 13 feet.  Depths in the Miami River are not marked on the chart (see encl 4). Vessels with drafts exceeding 13 feet commonly transit the lower portion of the Miami River.\n \n 12. Approximately 150 feet to the west of the NW 5TH ST bridge, the Seybold Canal dumps into the Miami River from the north.  Although not shown on NOAA chart 11467, there is an area of shoaling in the Miami River at the mouth of\n the Seybold Canal.  The canal's depth is about 5 feet.  The depth of the river goes from 9 feet at the entrance to the canal and gradually increases to a\n depth of approximately 16 feet deep 50 feet from the north bank of the river. This shoaling was discovered 07MAR01 by USCG investigators onboard a USCG Aids to Navigation Team Miami boat which was equipped with a fathometer (see encl 13).  Neither Mr.  Nolan nor Mr. Ratican expressed any knowledge of this shoaling prior to alliding with the NW 5TH ST bridge on 03FEB01.\n \n 13. The NW 5TH ST bridge crosses the Miami River approximately 1.7 NM from the mouth of the river.  The NW 5TH ST bridge is oriented on a line that runs\n almost exactly northeast to southwest.  The bridge is a bascule or lift bridge with a horizontal clearance of 75 ft as shown on NOAA chart 11467 (see encl 4). The fender system and concrete structure on the north side of the bridge show evidence of numerous, previous allisions.  The fender system was constructed against the bridge abutments and provides little or no protection if the flared bow or overhanging stern of a vessel with high freeboard impacts the fender system at an angle.  The fender system on the north bridge abutment tapers from a protective width of approx. 5 feet at the center of the abutment to a\n protective width of less than 2 feet at the eastern-most corner of the abutment where the majority of the damage to the bridge occurred (see encl 8 and encl\n 9).  The north span was not able to be raised to the fully upright position due to modifications made to the structure over the years and the top of the opened span extended several feet past the protective edge of the fender system.\n \n 14. The USACOE was the federal agency responsible for regulating the construction and operation of bridges at the time of the bridge's approval and construction.  The NW 5TH ST bridge was deemed an \"illegal\" structure by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) in 1929 shortly after the bridge was completed (see encl 14.b, encl 14.c and encl 15).  The USACOE's report dated June 30, 1924 (see encl 14.a) approved construction of the bridge with a horizontal opening at right angles to the axis of the channel of at least 75 feet.  Due to the angle at which the bridge was positioned across the Miami River, the distance between the faces of the abutments needed to be 85 feet to achieve this horizontal opening of at least 75 feet.  As constructed, the distance between the faces of the abutments is approximately 73 feet and the horizontal opening at right angles to the axis of the channel is less than 65 feet (see encl 14.c, encl 16 and encl 18).  The Coast Guard is the federal agency now tasked with oversight and regulation of bridges.  The bridge's file is maintained at the Seventh Coast Guard District office. \n \n 15. Additionally, the bridge was designed and the USACOE approved it for construction with a 15 feet opening in the north abutment to provide current flow relief.  The bridge was constructed without this opening.  Lack of this opening is also cited as a reason by the USACE in making a determination that the bridge is an \"illegal\" structure (see encl 14.b).  The north bridge abutment extends approximately 25 feet into the channel past the harbor line (see encl 5) and south bridge abutment extends approximately 50 feet into the channel past the harbor line.  The entire flow of the 150 feet wide river is restricted at this point and is channeled through the 75 feet wide opening of the NW 5TH ST bridge.  The resulting currents in the vicinity of the bridge frequently change and are often unpredictable.  A large vessel passing through the bridge opening effectively dams the flow of the river and is subjected to a much-exaggerated force from the river's current. \n \n 16. The M\/V SHASHA BOEKANIER was moored portside to the Ameritrade facility on the south bank of the river and immediately to the east of the south abutment\n of the NW 5TH ST bridge.  The SHASHA BOEKANIER is a 678 GT coastal freighter with a length of 163 feet and a beam of 30.8 feet.  The vessel's bow was approximately 20 feet from the bridge tender's house which is located on the east side of the south abutment (see encl 10).  The starboard half of the SHASHA BOEKANIER's bow was protruding past an imaginary plane formed by the face of the south bridge abutment.  This imaginary plane formed by the abutment face ran parallel to, and several feet to port of, the SHASHA BOEKANIER's centerline.  Additionally, as shown on the 1990 USACOE aerial survey, the Ameritrade facility's seawall has been extended approximately 20 feet into the channel beyond the harbor line.  Combined, these two factors place the outboard side of the SHASHA BOEKANIER's bow about 20 feet from the centerline of the normally 150 feet wide channel (see encl 6, diagrams 1-6).  The resulting effective channel width is approximately 65 feet which is the minimum required by 33 CFR 165.726(b)(4) (see encl 21). \n \n 17. At 2100, 02FEB01, the JOSEPH A and ANNELIESE arrived at the SARA EXPRESS' moorings and found her listing away from the pier, several degrees to port.\n The list was caused by the extreme low tide which had caused the SARA EXPRESS\n to ground while at her moorings.  The tugs placed lines on the vessel and attempted to pull her away from the pier, but were unsuccessful.  The tugs returned to their facility a short distance away and continued to watch the vessel's list.  They observed the SARA EXPRESS on an even keel just before midnight.  They then returned to the SARA EXPRESS and began to tow her down the river shortly after midnight.\n \n 18. As typical, the tow was favoring the north bank as it approached the NW 5TH ST bridge.  The speed of the tow was approximately 1.9 knots or about 3.2 feet per second.  At the entrance to the Seybold Canal, the SARA EXPRESS unexpectedly and suddenly began to sheer toward the south bridge abutment (see encl 6, diagram 1).  Mr. Nolan and Mr.  Ratican both stated that it appeared that the SARA EXPRESS' stern had hit the bottom and was forced toward the south.  Mr. Paul Hill, a P&L observer onboard the SARA EXPRESS, stated that he felt an unusual sensation, much like the vessel bumping the bottom, just as the SARA EXPRESS began to sheer to the south.  Mr. Cilo Espinosa, master of the SARA EXPRESS, was unable to recall such a sensation at that point.  He attributed any sensations he felt to the forces exerted by the tugs on the SARA EXPRESS.  The sudden sheer to the south by the vessel is confirmed by the NW 5TH ST bridge tender, Ms. Tequita Crumpton.\n \n 19. Mr. Nolan, master of the JOSEPH A, determined from his position trailing\n the SARA EXPRESS that the sudden sheer to the south and the vessel's forward momentum were going to result in the SARA EXPRESS alliding with the south abutment of the bridge.  He immediately told Mr. Ratican on the lead tug ANNELIESE to start pulling the stern of the SARA EXPRESS hard to the north.\n The ANNELIESE began pulling in a northerly direction.  At the same time, Mr. Nolan in the trail tug JOSEPH A began pushing the hawser attached to the bow of the SARA EXPRESS hard to the south in an effort to pivot the vessel and turn\n the SARA EXPRESS' stern to the left and away from the south abutment (see encl 6, diagram 3).  \n \n 20. The combined efforts of the JOSEPH A and the ANNELIESE resulted in the\n stern turning to the left and narrowly clearing the south abutment.  The\n extreme forces required to be exerted by the tugs to prevent the allision with\n the south abutment now caused the SARA EXPRESS' stern to move north toward the north abutment at a fast rate.\n \n 21. The JOSEPH A was now oriented with her bow to the south and her stern to\n the north (see encl 6, diagram 3).  Mr. Nolan, on the JOSEPH A, quickly determined the stern's sheering action to the north now had to be checked to keep the stern from alliding with the north abutment.  Due to the close proximity of the north bank, the JOSEPH A's rudders and screws would have struck bottom if Mr. Nolan had attempted to check the north movement of the SARA EXPRESS' stern by backing down toward the north bank to pull the SARA EXPRESS' bow to the north (see encl 6, diagram 4).  Instead, Mr. Nolan attempted to maneuver the JOSEPH A's bow from the south to the north so that he could push the SARA EXPRESS's bow hawser to the north, which would have pivoted the SARA EXPRESS and slowed or checked the stern's rapid movement to the north without the risk of disabling the JOSEPH A (see encl 6, diagram 5).\n \n 22. The JOSEPH A was unable to reposition itself in time to complete the maneuver of pushing the SARA EXPRESS's bow hawser to the north and checking the stern's northward sheer.  The starboard quarter of the SARA EXPRESS' boat deck allided with the eastern-most girder of the north span.  The starboard corner\n of her transom hit the concrete sidewalk\/maintenance platform on the east side of the north bridge abutment (see encl 6, diagram 6).  \n \n 23. There were no injuries as a result of the incident.\n \n 24. Once the allision occurred, the SARA EXPRESS was maneuvered through the NW 5TH ST bridge and the remainder of the Miami River without further incident.\n \n 25. Mr. Nolan stated that the location of the SHASHA BOEKANIER was not a factor in the difficulties experienced in trying to prevent the allisions first with the south abutment and then with the north abutment on 03FEB01.  He did state, however, that vessels moored to the Ameritrade facility regularly pose a challenge during a typical transit through the NW 5TH ST bridge and was a\n factor in his decision to keep the tow so close to the north bank while approaching the NW 5TH ST bridge.\n \n 26. The Coast Guard was properly notified of the bridge allision in accordance with 46 CFR 4.05-1.\n \n 27. Following the bridge strike, the SARA EXPRESS, the JOSEPH A and the ANNELIESE were directed by the OCMI to moor at the south side of Dodge Island, Port of Miami, to facilitate investigation of the incident and inspection of\n the damages.  All vessels were moored at 0345.\n \n 28. The SARA EXPRESS sustained relatively minor damage to the upper starboard corner of the transom, including a 5 inch hole in the side shell plating just below the weather deck, buckled bulwarks, and bent handrails.  The SARA EXPRESS also sustained damage to a 2 feet wide by 1 foot deep section of deck, the\n deck-edge combing, and handrails on the starboard, after side of the boat\n deck.\n \n 29. Damage to the NW 5TH ST bridge was major, rendering the bridge inoperable and stuck in the upright position.  The eastern most girder buckled approx. 18 inches out of position.  In addition, the girder's trunnion pin was bent and\n the concrete sidewalk\/maintenance platform was pushed over approx. 30 degrees (see encl 7).  Contractors hired by the Florida Department of Transportation estimated repair costs to be about $2,000,000.\n \n 30. Alcohol breath tests were administered to Mr. Nolan and Mr. Ratican by 0420 and both tests were negative with 0.00 percent blood alcohol levels measured\n for both.  None of the crewmen exhibited any behavior which was indicative of being under the influence.  However, Mr. Ratican, master of the tug ANNELIESE, was observed to be drinking a large amount of fluids prior to investigators boarding his vessel.\n \n 31. Crewmembers from both tugs were directed to undergo chemical testing for drug use and all were subsequently tested on the morning of 03FEB01.  All tests were negative with the exception of tests for Mr. Ratican, master of the ANNELIESE, and Mr. Giles Woods, crewman on the JOSEPH A (see encl 3).  Both individuals tested positive for cocaine use and both were immediately terminated as employees for P&L.  \n \n 32. Mr. Woods does not hold a CG-issued Merchant Mariners Document or license.\n \n 33. The NW 5TH ST bridge has been struck 12 times in 13 years according to a Miami River Commission report (see encl 24).  Towing companies operating on the Miami River have consistently complained about the obruction to navigation posed by the bridge (see encl 17, encl 19, encl 22, encl 23 and encl 24).  The vast majority of marine casualties occurring on the Miami River have involved allisions with the SE 2ND AVE bridge and the the NW 5TH ST bridge.  Replacement of the SE 2ND AVE bridge begins in September 2001.  The Miami River Commission and the Miami River Marine Group (an organization of ship and terminal owners on the river) have both recommended that the NW 5TH ST bridge be replaced (see encl 24).\n \n CONCLUSIONS:\n \n 1. Florida state statutes 310.141 and 310.146(2) require vessels with a draft\n of 7 feet or more and operating in state waters to have a state pilot on board to direct their movements.  One exception is vessels transiting the Miami River which are being towed deadship by tugboats operated by federally licensed personnel.  Accordingly, the SARA EXPRESS was properly transiting the Miami River without a state pilot while being towed deadship by two tugboats operated by federally licensed personnel.\n \n 2. Safely maneuvering relatively large vessels deadship up and down the Miami River is a very difficult and demanding task due to the river's narrowness, numerous bends, and the restrictions posed by bridges spanning the river and numerous vessels moored along the river.  The operators of these tugs must have considerable knowledge of the river and considerable experience unique to operating tugs in this environment.  The knowledge and experience required is typically beyond that which is required of most tugboats operators.  Mr. Nolan and Mr. Ratican both appear to have the experience and knowledge necessary to properly operate tugs engaged in deadship tows on the Miami River.\n \n 3. As the stern of the SARA EXPRESS was approaching the NW 5TH ST bridge opening, it unexpectedly sheered to the south for unknown reasons.  Both tug masters recognized the vessel's unexpected action and took immediate corrective measures to prevent an allision with the south bridge abutment.\n \n 4. The actions required to avert the allision with the southern bridge abutment were of such a forceful nature that the SARA EXPRESS' stern was diverted to the north at a rate which could not be stopped in time to prevent the SARA EXPRESS from striking the north bridge abutment.\n \n 5. The primary factor in the JOSEPH A's inability to check this movement of the SARA EXPRESS' stern to the north by pulling or pushing the SARA EXPRESS' bow to the north and pivoting the vessel in a timely manner was the narrowness of the channel.  Mr. Nolan properly determined that he could not back down and pull the SARA EXPRESS's bow to the north due to the close proximity of the JOSEPH A's stern to the north bank and the substantial risk of disabling the JOSEPH A by running her rudders and screws aground.  Had there been adequate room astern of the JOSEPH A, Mr. Nolan most likely would have been able to properly check the swing of the SARA EXPRESS with a quick, hard pull on the bow hawser and prevented the allision with the north abutment.  Instead, Mr. Nolan properly determined that his only option was to quickly reposition the JOSEPH A's bow to the north and push the SARA EXPRESS' bow hawser to the north.  He attempted to do so, but was unable to complete the maneuver prior to the SARA EXPRESS alliding with the bridge.\n \n 6. The bridge fender system provided little protection against damage to the bridge from the SARA EXPRESS.  The limited protection provided is due to the fender system's closeness to the bridge abutment, its relatively short height compared to the height of the SARA EXPRESS' overhanging stern, and the angle at which the SARA EXPRESS impacted the bridge.\n \n 7. The reason for the SARA EXPRESS' sheer to the south is unknown, but could have been caused by several factors or a combination of factors.  It is reasonable to conclude that the stern of the SARA EXPRESS, which was favoring the north side of the channel, hit the uncharted area of shoaling at the entrance to the Seybold Canal (on the north side of the Miami River) and was deflected toward the south. \n \n 8. Another possible reason for the sheer is the phenomenon of a water cushion that develops as the river's water is compressed between a ship and the river \n bank\/deep draft channel edge when they converge.  Such a cushion may have\n formed at the area of shoaling and effectively pushed the SARA EXPRESS' stern\n to the south.  This scenario is less likely because the effect is normally more subtle, and SARA EXPRESS' sudden sheer was very pronounced.\n \n 9. Additionally, the unpredictable currents present at the bridge opening\n which are caused by the restriction of the river's flow, could have pushed the stern to the south.  This possibility is even less likely because this effect\n is even more subtle than the effect of a water cushion and, as previously stated, the SARA EXPRESS' sheer was very pronounced.  \n \n 10. The damming effect of a large vessel in the opening of the NW 5TH ST bridge could not be a factor since the sheer of the SARA EXPRESS' stern to the south occurred while the vessel was still 150 feet from the bridge opening. Additionally, this damming effect is normally most noticeable with an inbound vessel on an outgoing tide.\n \n 11. In summary, the apparent cause of the incident appears to be the unintentional grounding of the SARA EXPRESS on the uncharted shoal at the mouth of the Seybold Canal, and the subsequent loss of positive control of the SARA EXPRESS by the tugs as it suddenly \"bounced\" off the shoal while approaching\n the bridge opening.\n \n 12. A contributing factor appears to be the extremely low tide.  The area of shoaling at the mouth of the Seybold Canal had been passed over previously by the SARA EXPRESS and other vessels with similar drafts without incident.  The extreme low tide experienced just prior to the incident was unusual and\n resulted in the level of the river being 1 to 2 feet below normal at the time\n of the allision.  The shoaling at the mouth of the Seybold Canal became a\n factor due to this lower river level.\n \n 13. The location of the SHASHA BOEKANIER was a contributing factor in this incident.  The tow was required to hug the north bank while approaching the bridge opening to minimize the potential for an allision with the SHASHA BOEKANIER's starboard bow which was jutting into the south side of the channel and was less than 20 feet from the centerline of the channel.  Had the SHASHA BOEKANIER posed less of an obstruction on the far side of the bridge opening, the tow probably would have made its approach at a greater distance from the north bank and probably would not have grounded on the area of shoaling.\n \n 14. The extension of the seawall at the Ameritrade facility into the channel 20 feet past the harbor line contributes significantly to the obstruction that vessels moored at the facility pose at the southeast corner of the bridge opening.  The location of the seawall at the Ameritrade facility can also be considered a contributing factor.\n \n 15. Attempting to move a vessel of the length, beam and draft of the SARA EXPRESS through a bridge such as the NW 5TH ST bridge is an obvious\n contributing factor to the grounding and subsequent allision with the bridge.\n It is reasonable to conclude that when the bridges spanning the Miami River\n were designed and built in the 1920's and 1930's, ships of this size were not expected to transit the river.  This is most likely the reason that no action was taken to address the USACOE's determination that the NW 5TH ST bridge was\n an \"illegal\" structure due to its less than 75 feet of horizontal clearance at right angles to the axis of the channel.  While there are obvious economic incentives for larger vessels of greater capacity to transit the Miami River, there are no regulations limiting the size of vessels transiting the river. Continued operation of large, medium-draft vessels on the Miami River with no improvement to the horizontal restrictions caused by this bridge will most likely result in similar incidents in the future.\n \n 16. There is no evidence of negligence or misconduct on the part of either Mr. Nolan or Mr. Ratican with regard to their actions related to the maneuvering of the SARA EXPRESS through the NW 5TH ST bridge.\n \n 17. Although Mr. Ratican tested positive for cocaine, there is no evidence\n that drug use by Mr. Ratican contributed to the incident or that he was under the influence or intoxicated at the time of the incident.\n \n RECOMMENDATION:\n \n 1.

{"activity_id":2994,"brief":"On 19MAR01, an 18.5'  flats boat driven by  a CG Licensed mariner, allided with a signpost at the foot of the 17th St Bridge in Vero Beach, FL.  At the time of the allision, the vessel was operated as an un-inspected passenger vessel with 2 passengers on board.  The force of the allision ejected the operator and one of his passengers.  The other passenger was not ejected but suffered fatal injuries.\n\nFurther information concerning this case is contained within the Narrative Supplement which was complied by the original Investigating Officers.  \n\nIAW message P 051900Z OCT 01 CGDSEVEN MIAMI FL\/\/ICP\/\/ para 3, (M) and G-MOA Policy Letter 2-02, the marine casualty investigation of the subject case has been conducted as a data collection investigation.\n\n\n\n\n CASUALTY SUMMARY:\n 19MAR01, 18.5' flats boat operated as a 6-pack vessel with 2 passengers was being operated by John Jackson.  The vessel allided with a sign post at the\n foot of the 17th St Bridge Vero Beach, FL.  The allision ejected the operator & passengers into the water. One passenger and the operator were ejected into the water.  Both passenger sustained injuries due to the casualty with one\n passenger dying. The operator did not sustain any injuries.\n \n OPERATOR:\n John E. Jackson\n 3030 PAR Drive\n Vero Beach, FL 32960\n 561-567-6550\n CG License # 840133, \" Master of Great Lakes and Inland Steam or Motor vessels of not more than 50 Gross Tons: also operator of Uninspected Passenger Vessels as defined in 46 USC 2101 (42) upon Near Coastal Waters.\" Issued 22 Sep97 out of MSO Miami.\n \n WEATHER:\n Daylight with approx 1\/2 mile visibility due to rain (worsening), visibility considered poor.  Wind 25 mph from SSE.\n \n INJURIES:\n ED FRANCIS  -  sustained fractured\/bruised ribs;\n David Peterson  -  Deceased, sustained blunt trama from the back of the head\/neck to the lower back.  (See Police report)\n \n FACTS:\n Following is based on information gathered by USCG Investigation officers LT Lingaitis & MST1 Garcia during the 20MAR01 interview with John Jackson:\n - UPV operated by USCG licensed operator John E. Jackson.\n - UPV operation got underway approx 0700 on 19MAR01 for a half day charter with Ed Francis & David Peterson.  Confirmed with Ed Francis.\n - 1100: Wind & rain increasing.\n - 1130: Decision made to return to dock due to worsening weather.  Mr Peterson was seated to the left of the operator and Mr Francis was seated directly in front of the operator's station as per the operators instructions.  Confirmed\n w\/ Mr. Francis.                                                  \n - VSL being operated at approx 23-25 mph on a NNW course, the wind was 25 mph from the SSE, with rain worsening thus decreasing the visibility to approx 0.5 mile.\n - 1145: Approx 50 yds frm the bridge the operator encountered increased wind driven waves & wakes frm other vessels.\n - 1145: Vsl allided with a sign post at the foot of the 17th Street Bridge. According to Vero Beach, Marine Investigator the sign post was exposed 5.5-6 feet.  The operator stated that Mr Francis was a distraction by the nature of him being seated at the center bow position in the operators field of view.\n - Vsl's port bow allided with the sign post & the operator was pushed or fell into the throttle resulting in the vessel being launched forward & alliding with the base of the bridge.  \n - the operator & Mr Peterson were ejected from the vessel. \n - Mr Peterson was medically evacuated via helo to the hospital & Mr Francis was treated by EMS and transported to the hospital via ambulance. \n - Jackson stated that he normally transits at a higher speed and his normal return route takes him through the center span of the bridge, the shortcut that he attempted to use was 2 spans to the east of normal transits.  He stated that he was attempting to reduce the transit time & the affects of the weather on\n his passengers.\n - The operator did not have a sufficient lookout due to positioning one passenger directly infront of his field of visibility.\n -The operator was operating at excessive speed in reduced\/obstructed visibility.\n \n CONCLUSION:\n 19Mar01:  Approx 0700 Mr. John Jackson; holder of USCG Lic #840133, Master 50\n GT also Operator Uninspected Passenger Vessel, got underway with two passengers onboard. He was operating a 18.5' flats boat with a 175 HP outboard motor.  \n Approx 1130 it was decided to cease fishing for the day. The weather was worsening to the following:  Increased rain, visibility reduced to 1\/2 NM, wind from the SSE at 25 knt.  The operator place one passenger in the center of the cockpit facing aft (directly infornt of the operating station) and the other to the left of the operator.  The passenger facing aft was place there to prevent rain & wind from blowing in his face. While returning to the dock the wind was at their backs. The operator chose to take a shortcut passing under a different span of the 17th Street bridge (a different route than normally transitted) to save some time.  The operator was traveling at approx 23-24 mph.  During an interview he stated that this speed was less than his normal operating speed. Prior to passing under the bridge the operator stated that he encountered wave\n & waked created by boat traffic & wind. The operator struck an object in the water which was later determined to be a cement sign post (sign missing) which was exposed approx. 2.5 feet out of the water.  After hitting the post either a passenger or the operator fell into the throttle and the boat struck the 17th Street Bridge, ejecting one passenger & operator.  One passenger was severily injured and medivaced to the hospital where he later died.  The other passenger sustained brused\/fractured ribs.  \n The casualty resulted due to failure to observe Rules of the Road's rule 5 (lookout) and rule 6 (safe speed).\n \n Recommendation:  \n MSO Miami initiate S&R action against the operator for neg ops w\/ the spec. of Rules 5 & 6.                               \n \n Enclosures:\n 1.

Ms. Comeaux stated that each time the M\/V REPENT struck the bank she called the master of the M\/V REPENT to inquire to the problem.  Each time the master, Timothy Matherne, replied that he was having steering problems.  It was the opinion of the Bridge tender that the master of the M\/V REPENT was falling asleep because he sounded groggy on the radio.\n \n The M\/V SONNY COOK was approximately 500 yards astern of the M\/V REPENT at the time of the allision.  The master of M\/V SONNY COOK, Lester Naquin, stated he heard the bridge tender's calls to the M\/V REPENT, confirming the bridge tender's statement.\n \n The Marine Surveyor, (John Wiggins), inspected the M\/V REPENT's steering system and verified that the entire system was operating correctly and stated that the allision was not due to mechanical error.\n \n During the onboard investigation immediately after the allision, Timothy Matherne appeared to fall asleep multiple times in the presence of the CG Investigator.

He stated he did not have a prescription for Xanax.  Mr. Matherne also stated he received a\n urine sample from his deckhand and that he substituted that sample as his own during a required post casualty drug screen required by American Tugs.\n \n MSO MORGAN City initiated a Personnel action case.  A Settlement Agreement was signed for use of dangerous drug.

The Cairo gauge was at approx. 29' and the current in excess of 6 mph.  He misjudged the current and allided with the Illinois pier with the aft barge in port string.  The tow broke and, as a result of damages sustained during the allision, the barge that allided with the pier subsequently sank at MM 953.5 on the LMR.\n\n\n SUBJECT:\n M\/V STONEWALL JACKSON, O.N. 647465, allision with the Cairo Highway Bridge on the Upper Mississippi River at Mile Marker 0.5 on May 3, 2001.\n \n SUMMARY:\n On May 3, 2001, at approximately 1745, the M\/V STONEWALL JACKSON was southbound on the Upper Mississippi River approaching the center span of the Cairo Highway Bridge at Mile Marker 0.5.  The Cairo gauge was at approximately 29 feet and the current was in excess of 6 mph.  The weather was clear and sunny.  There were no other vessels in the area.\n \n As the Master approached the bridge he misjudged the drift caused by the swift current and allided with the Illinois pier in the center span with the aft most barge in the tow's port string.  The allision broke the tow loose with three barges adrift independently and the remaining 23 remaining intact as one unit. As a result of the damages it sustained during the allision, the barge that allided with the pier subsequently sank at Mile Marker  953.5 on the Lower Mississippi River.  After the allision the Master stated that in his 30+ years of piloting on the Mississippi he has never seen such swift conditions in the Cairo, IL area.\n \n CONCLUSIONS:\n The apparent cause of the casualty was the failure of the Master of the M\/V STONEWALL JACKSON to accurately assess the river's current and drift.\n \n A contributing cause to this casualty was the high river conditions present at the time of the allision.  With the Cairo gauge at 29 feet and the Upper Mississippi River swollen with high water, the current flowing around the bend and approaching the bridge was in excess of 6 mph.\n \n RECOMMENDATIONS:\n It is recommended that a further investigation be initiated in the case of Alvia Edward Hester, operator of the M\/V STONEWALL JACKSON, concerning his part in this casualty.\n \n With the above exceptions, there is no evidence of actionable misconduct, inattention to duty, or negligent or willful violation of law or regulation on the part of licensed or certificated personnel; nor any evidence of failure of inspected equipment or material; nor evidence that any personnel of the Coast Guard or of any other federal agency, or any other person contributed to this casualty.

PARTICULARS OF THE SIDNEY SHERMAN\/IH 610 BRIDGE: \n \n 1.  The construction of the Sidney Sherman\/IH 610 Bridge, often referred to as the Houston Ship Channel Bridge, was commenced during the Summer of 1979 and completed in May 1982.  The bridge is of post-tensioned prestressed concrete box girder design, constructed by cast-in-place balance cantilever methods. The main span is 750 feet with the main piers of the bridge consisting of 38 ft x 20 ft hollow boxes with 2 ft thick walls.  They are of conventional reinforced concrete construction utilizing 5500 psi concrete.  Each pier is founded on 255 two foot diameter pipe piles with a 15 ft concrete pile cap that measures 75 ft x 81 ft. The top elevation of this pile cap is -10 ft, bottom - 25 ft.  The bridge is an important part of the City of Houston's transportation infrastructure, allowing commercial and non-commercial vehicular traffic to bypass the city's congested downtown area.  It has been previously struck by vessel traffic, most recently on 07 Sep 00 by the M\/V MEDITERRANEAN and on 01 Dec 99 by the M\/V AL RAYYAN.\n \n III.  FINDINGS OF FACT:\n \n 1.  At approximately 1625, 21 Dec 00, the  time of the pilot's (ROBERT K. ARTHUR JR.) arrival aboard the vessel at sea, the No. 2 aft stulcken derrick which eventually struck the Sidney Sherman\/IH 610 Bridge was rigged for sea at an inclination angle of approximately 6 degrees to the vertical (Verbal Statement IVAN KREGAR made to investigators Bryan and D'Orazio; Verbal Statement Chief Officer ANDREW BENITEZ made to investigators Bryan and D'Orazio).\n \n 2.  At approximately 1640, 21 Dec 00 the pilot, ROBERT K. ARTHUR JR., during review of the vessel's particulars and air draft observed that the vessel's air draft exceeded 135 feet, the vertical clearance of the Sydney Sherman\/IH 610 Bridge (Written Statement ROBERT K. ARTHUR JR.; Verbal Statement IVAN KREGAR to investigators Bryan and D'Orazio).\n \n 3.  At approximately 1645, 21 Dec 00 the pilot, ROBERT K. ARTHUR JR., notified the vessel's master, IVAN KREGAR, that the vessel's air draft was too high and that to allow a safety factor the vessel's air draft must be under 132 feet.\n The master agreed to have the derricks lowered and air draft recalculated (Written Statement ROBERT K. ARTHUR JR.; Verbal Statement IVAN KREGAR to investigators Bryan and D'Orazio).\n \n 4.  Prior to the vessel, which was proceeding inbound into the Port of Houston to  moor portside at City Dock 17 (a transit that would require the vessel to proceed past City Dock 17, under the Sydney Sherman\/IH 610 Bridge to the\n turning basin where it would make a 180 degree turn and backtrack under the bridge again to City Dock 17), reaching Morgans Point the vessel's Chief Officer, ANDREWS BENITEZ, based upon his review of the ships plans and other\n relevant documents, calculated that the vessel's derricks would have to be lowered to an approximately 45 degree angle to achieve an air draft of 129\n feet.  He then supervised the lowering of the derricks, choosing to make use of his \"mariner's eye\" to judge the angle of the derricks in lieu of utilizing angle indicators affixed to the derricks (Written Statement ROBERT K. ARTHUR JR.; Verbal Satement IVAN KREGAR to investigators Bryan and D'Orazio; Verbal Statement ANDREWS BENITEZ to investigators Bryan and D'Orazio; Written Statements of M\/V RICKMERS TIANJIN Crew).\n \n 5.  Prior to the allision the pilot,  ROBERT K. ARTHUR JR., was notified\n that the vessel's air draft was 129 feet (Houston Pilots Vessel Transit Card signed by the vessel's master IVAN KREGAR; Pilot Card All Ships Columbia Ship Management LTD Form Code SNA.22-AX-0 Issue Date 7\/95 signed by vessel's master on 21 Dec 00; Written Stament ROBERT K. ARTHUR JR.; Verbal Statement IVAN KREGAR to investigators Bryan and D'Orazio).\n \n 6.  Prior to the allision the pilot, ROBERT K. ARTHUR JR., had available\n ship's manuevering information required under the provisions of 33 CFR 164.35 (g)(6) (Pilot Card All Ships Columbia Ship Management LTD Form Code SNA.22-AX-0 Issue Date 7\/95 signed by vessel's master on 21 Dec 00; Maneuvering Characteristics [Posted on Bridge]).                \n \n 7.  At approximately 2128, 21 Dec 01 the No. 2 aft Stulcken Crane of the M\/V RICKMERS TIANJIN did allide with the Sydney Sherman\/IH 610 Bridge causing the following damage:\n \n a.  M\/V RICKMERS TIANJIN: Constructive loss of the No. 2 aft Stulcken Crane and adjacent protective guardrails.\n \n b.  Sydney Sherman\/IH 610 Bridge: Road slabs (eastmost, above the channel) destroyed between girder 6 and girder 5, girder web 6 cracked, girder 6 stiffeners damaged, girder 5 web and flange damaged, 2 diafram and wind brace connections in way of girder 6 damaged, diafram connection in way of girder 5 damaged, and localized bridge lighting destroyed (Full engineering details available from the Texas Department of Transportation, PO Box 1386, Houston TX 77521  tel# (713) 802-5000).\n \n 8.  At the time of the allision the vessel's chief officer, ANDREWS BENITEZ, possessed the technical knowledge necessary to calculate proper air draft for the vessel (21 Dec 00 demonstration by Chief Officer to USCG Investigators\n Bryan and D'Orazio; Chief Officer post-incident air draft calculations).\n \n 9.  At the time of the vessel's allision with the bridge, the posted bridge clearances were substantally correct providing on average approximately 4\n inches more clearance than posted (Texas Department of Transportation 13 Dec 1999 Bridge Clearance Report contained within Texas Department of\n Transportation post incident documentation dated 11 Jan 2001; 15 Dec 1999 Texas Department of Transportation letter for Eighth Coast Guard District Bridge Administration Branch). \n \n 10.  At the time of the vessel's allision with the bridge winds were calm,\n skies were clear, visibility was unimpeded, and temperature was approximately\n 45 degrees Fahrenheit (COGARD MSO Houston Galveston Galena Park TX SITREP One dtg 220952Z Dec 00) and no unusual currents in the vicinity of the bridge were present (Verbal Statement Pilot ROBERT ARTHUR to investigators Bryan and D'Orazio). \n \n 11.  Post incident drug and alcohol testing of the following M\/V RICKMERS\n TIANJIN crewmemembers conducted by Marine Medical Inc. did not reveal the presence of alcohol or dangerous drug metabolites: A. ALVIAR (OS), L. DOLOTINA (1ST Engineer), I. Kregar (Master), A. MONZALES (2nd Enginer), and R. YNIESTRA (3rd Engineer) (Marine Medical Inc. Drug Profile dated 04 Jan 01 for A. ALVIAR; Marine Medical Inc. Drug Profile dated 04 Jan 01 for L. DOLONITA; Marine\n Medical Inc. Drug Profile dated 04 Jan 01 for I. KREGAR; Marine Medical Inc. Drug Profile dated 04 Jan 01 for A. MONZALES; Marine Medical Inc. Drug Profile dated 04 Jan 01 for R. YNIESTRA; Marine Medical Inc. Alcohol Log dated 22 Dec 00). \n \n 12.  Post incident drug and alcohol testing of the pilot ROBERT V. ARTHUR JR.\n by Marine Medical Inc. did not reveal the presence of alcohol or dangerous drug metabolites (Marine Medical Inc. Drug Profile dated 26 Dec 00 for ROBERT\n ARTHUR; Marine Medical Inc. Alcohol Log dated 21 Dec 00 for ROBERT ARTHUR).\n \n 13. Though no post incident drug and alcohol testing of the Chief Officer ANDREWS BENITEZ was conducted, direct observation of the Chief Officer by investigators Bryan and D'Orazio did not reveal specific, contemporaneous physical, behavioral, or performance indicators of probable use.\n \n 14. During the investigation there was no evidence discovered to indicate\n vessel or crew non-adherence with the provisions of the International\n Convention on Standards, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978 as amended (STCW Convention) and the Seafarer's Training, Certification and Watchkeeping Code as amended (STCW Code).\n \n IV.    CONCLUSIONS:\n \n Based upon the investigation it is concluded that:\n \n 1.  The proximate cause of the incident was the Chief Officer's (ANDREW BENITEZ) negligient failure to utilize the No. 2 stulcken derrick's angle indicator to ensure that the stulcken derrick was properly positioned to avoid allision with the bridge.\n \n 2.  Contributing to incident was the Master's (IVAN KREGAR) negligient failure to properly verify that the Chief Officer had properly positioned the No. 2 stulcken derrick utilizing the derrick's angle indicator.\n \n 3.  The positioning of the stulcken derrick at an inclination of 6 degrees to the vertical at the time of the pilot's arrival aboard the vessel was\n reasonable and in accordance with instructions from the vessel's builder (Kawasaki Heavy Industries LTD Instruction Book for 225 T Stulcken Derrick F2- W81 Finished Plan 26 Jul 79, Section V (Sea Lashing), page 14) \n \n 4.  Meteorological and\/or current conditions were not contributary to the cause of the incident.       \n \n 5.  Vessel equipment failure was not contributary to the cause of the incident.\n \n 6.  The use or or addiction to dangerous drugs and\/or alcohol was not contributary to the cause of the incident.\n \n 7.  Personnel fatigue was not contributary to the cause of the incident. \n 8.  The level of personnel training and qualification, including the Chief Officer's (ANDREWS BENITEZ) was sufficient to have have prevented this incident.\n \n 9.  The pilot, ROBERT K. ARTHUR JR., did not commit any act or ommision\n that directly or indirectly caused or contributed to the allision which\n occurred other than to reasonably rely upon the vessel's air draft calculation that was provided to him by the vessel's master, IVAN KREGAR, who had verified the Chief Officer's (ANDREW BENITEZ) calculations.  \n \n 10.  The owner of the Sidney Sherman\/IH 610 Bridge, the Texas Department of Transportation, did not commit any act or ommision that directly or indirectly caused or contributed to the allision which occurred.\n \n V.     RECOMMENDATIONS:\n \n 1.  There are no recommendations associated with this case for changes to existing International treaties, conventions, or United States laws and regulations pertaining to any aspect of vessel operation, crew training, waterways management on the Houston Ship Channel or bridges over navigable waters of the United States.   \n \n 2.  Pursuant to the provisions of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 as amended, Chapter 1 Regulation 11 (c), the recognized organization responsible for issuing relevant certificates on behalf of the flag administration, Det Norske Veritas, was notified of the accident. \n VI.

The\n apparent cause of the allision was failure of the pilot to adequately navigate\n a course of transit under the bridge.  Two barges sustained $20,987.63 in damage.  No other damage, pollution, or injuries occurred.\n \n FACTS\n \n \n The Tug TED WAXLER is a 120 foot, 2560 hp, diesel-powered tug.  Vessel is owned by the Thomas Transportation Corporation and operated by the Waxler Towing\n Company, Inc..  The tug was pushing ahead four empty red flag barges\n southbound.  On the morning of the incident, there were seven people on board, including the captain, Mr. George A. Duncan, and the pilot, Mr. Harry G. Roe. \n \n On 15 August 2001, at approx. 0100,(see enclosure #1) the weather was clear\/no moon with a temperature of 78 degrees.  Visibility was good with a range of 12 miles.  Wind speed was calm, current speed was southbound at 1 - 1.5 mph.\n River stage was 10.75 ft., (see enclosure #2).\n \n Mr. Harry G. Roe was the pilot of the Tug TED WAXLER, on the morning of 15 August 2001.  Mr. Roe is a sixty-four year old male, who attained his pilot's license at the age of twenty-two, after two years as a deckhand.  Mr. Roe has been employed in the marine industry for 47 years.  Mr. Roe returned to\n piloting eight months prior to this incident after a three and a half-year\n lay-off due to bladder cancer.  At the time of incident, Mr. Roe was taking medication for his blood pressure and sugar diabetes, (See enclosure #7).\n During the eight months since his return, Mr. Roe has piloted three short\n trips, five to 10 days in duration and twice on long trips, normally 30 days in duration.  Mr. Roe was on duty for approx. one hour prior to the incident. \n \n On 07 August 2001, the Tug TED WAXLER, got underway pushing ahead four empty\n red flag barges southbound, from Paducah, Kentucky to its destination in Krotz Springs, Louisiana.  The tow entered the Atchafalaya River on 15 August 2001, with Mr. Harry G. Roe piloting the vessel.  At approx. 0100, the tow approached a bend in the Atchafalaya River where the KCS Railroad Bridge crosses, located\n at MM4.5, (see enclosure #3).  On information received from Captain George A. Duncan, Mr. Roe decided to transit under the west-side span of the bridge\n rather than the normal route, the east-side span.  Captain Duncan informed Mr. Roe that a rock barge dumped rock under the east-side span, making a hazardous transit when the river gauge is at a low level.  Mr. Roe acknowledged piloting vessels under the bridge 100 - 150 times throughout his career, three times since his return eight months prior to this, but normally through the east-side span. The tow was positioned to transit straight through the west-side span, at a speed of 11 mph, but Mr. Roe acknowledged that the speed of the tow was too fast for the turn.  Halfway under the bridge, the tow came too close to the right descending pier and allided it's two starboard barges into the KCS Railroad Bridge.  Before the allision, Mr. Roe stated he felt like something was pushing the tow to starboard, so he counter-maneuvered by putting on a hard starboard rudder to swing the stern out, however this had no effect (see enclosure #8).  Mr. Roe noted that after the tow was between the bridge piers, the current had a tremendous set to the starboard side.  Mr. Roe stated that he felt the Tug TED WAXLER could make good speed for such a wide bridge span, but acknowledged that he should have reduced speed and flanked the tow around the bend and through the west-side bridge span.  Four wires, which held the barges together, broke upon the allision with the bridge pier, however, the tow did not break apart.  Two barges suffered damage in the allision (see enclosures #4,#5,#6). The WTC 115B sustained damage to the port stern corner, knuckle and cap plating.  The STC 125 sustained damage to the #5 starboard cargo tank, which began leaking water water into the void at a rate of 5\" per\/hour.  After the allision, Mr. Roe had the wires secured between the tow, then continued underway, leaving the scene.  A tankerman was manned to provide surveillance of the barges.  Mr. Roe informed no one of the allision until Mr. Duncan, Captain, awoke at approximately 0600.  Mr. Roe acknowledged that he was in some \"state of shock\" and \"wasn't thinking right\" when he failed to report the allision at the time of the incident.  Mr. Duncan, Captain, notified Waxler Towing Company, who in turn notified the United States Coast Guard.  \n \n APPARENT CAUSE\n \n \n The apparent cause of the casualty was failure of the vessel's pilot to\n navigate a course of transit under the KCS Railroad Bridge.\n \n ROOT CAUSE\n \n \n The root cause of the casualty is the Tug TED WAXLER was transiting too fast (Approx. 11 mph) in a southbound direction where there was a bend in the river with a railroad bridge crossing.  Mr. Roe stated that he felt the Tug TED\n WAXLER could make good speed for such a wide bridge span, however he also acknowledged the tow's speed was a little too fast when the allision occurred. Mr. Roe further acknowledged that if he could do it all over again, he would have reduced speed and flanked the tow to navigate around the bend and under\n the bridge.\n \n CONTRIBUTING FACTORS\n \n \n Time away from piloting was a contributing factor in the allision.  Mr. Roe\n was piloting vessels for only eight months following a three and a half-year layoff, due to medical problems.  This trip was only his second 30-day trip\n back since his return eight months prior.  Mr. Roe stated that he was in some state of shock and wasn't thinking right when he failed to report the incident and left the scene. \n Area familiarization was a contributing factor in the allision. During the\n eight months prior to the incident, Mr. Roe transited the KCS Bridge three times and only under the east-side span, not the west-side where the incident occurred.  Taking into consideration the three and a half years Mr. Roe was out of the marine industry and eight months since his return, he has only transited under the bridge three times, with none of the transits under the west-span where the incident occurred.\n \n RECOMMENDATIONS\n \n \n This case has been forwarded to the personnel action team for review.\n \n \n Enclosure(s):\n \n \n 1.

Prior to 0221 The M\/V MR. BARRY was u\/w west bound, pushing a T\/B fully loaded with a cargo of PPM (propane-propylene mix), and pushed up on the North bank of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) mile marker 132.5, 1.5 miles east of the Louisa Bridge awaiting the arrival of their relief pilot.\n 2. 0221 The M\/V VICTORIA CENAC and the M\/V DONALD E CLARK pushing westbound and the M\/V RICOHOC pushing eastbound asked for an opening, received permission and transited through the Louisa Bridge.\n 3. 0253 The Louisa Bridge closed.\n 4. 0320 The M\/V BAYOU VOYAGER pushing westbound, passed the MR BARRY, asked the Louisa Bridge Tender for an opening, received permission, the bridge opened and they transited the Louisa Bridge.\n 5. 0333 The Louisa Bridge closed.\n 6. 0330 The M\/V MAGGIE RAE was u\/w pushing westbound and the M\/V LADY JEANETTE was light boat u\/w west bound toward the Louisa Bridge.\n 7. 0350 (approximate) The LADY JEANETTE overtook the MAGGIE RAE and they both passed the MR BARRY who was still pushed up on the bank.\n 8. 0410 (approximate) The MR BARRY's relief Pilot arrived at and drove his vehicle across the Louisa Bridge to speak to the Bridge Tender.\n 9. 0413 The LADY JEANETTE and the MAGGIE RAE u\/w westbound asked the Louisa Bridge Tender for an opening, received permission, the bridge opened and they transited through the Louisa Bridge.\n 10. 0415 (approximate) The Bridge Tender, Ruby Simon spoke to the pilot of the MR BARRY on VHF, giving them info that the MR BARRY's relief Pilot, Richard Harding, was at the bridge, and that the bridge was going to close to allow the relief to drive back across the bridge.\n 11. 0420 (approximate) The MR BARRY got u\/w without telling the Bridge.\n 12. 0425 The Louisa Bridge closed and allowed the relief pilot to drive his vehicle to the north side of the channel to facilitate their relief process. The LADY JEANETTE continued westbound GIWW. The MAGGIE RAE pushed up against the bank mile to the west.\n 13. 0435 (approximate) The Bridge Tender began opening of the bridge for the MR BARRY.\n 14.  The MR BARRY struck the bridge with its barge while the bridge was only fifty- percent open breaking relief valves and cracking piping on the STBD\n Tank, allowing product to be released into the atmosphere.\n \n Narrative:\n 19 July 2001, prior to 0221, the M\/V MR. BARRY pushed up to the bank 1 1\/2\n miles east of the Louisa Bridge, waiting for the relief Pilot, Richard Harding to arrive.  The M\/V LADY JEANETTE overtook the M\/V MAGGIE RAE and they both passed the MR BARRY and proceeded westbound toward the Louisa Bridge. The\n relief Pilot arrived and drove across to the south side of the bridge\n requesting the Bridge Tender Ruby Simon to contact the MR. BARRY and tell him that Richard Harding, the relief Pilot was ready for the crew change. At the same time, the operators of the M\/V LADY JEANETTE, Robert Newcombe, and the M\/V MAGGIE RAE, Randall Smith asked the Bridge Tender for an opening to pass.  The Bridge Tender acknowledged and opened the bridge to allow them to transit. The Bridge Tender then called the MR. BARRY and informed the Pilot, Mr. Hasley L. Prosperie, that the MR BARRY's relief Pilot, Richard Harding was waiting at the bridge. The Pilot of the MR.BARRY, Hasley Prosperie, requested a bridge opening, but the Bridge Tender, Ruby Simon told the Pilot of the MR. BARRY, Hasley Prosperie no, that she would close the bridge to marine traffic first and allow their relief Pilot, Richard Harding to drive to the north side of the channel. Both the relief Pilot for the Mr. BARRY and the Pilot of the MAGGIE RAE, Randall Smith, confirmed hearing the radio communication exchange, that the bridge would be closed to marine traffic. The LADY JEANNETTE and the MAGGIE RAE had passed through the Louisa Bridge opening, with the LADY JEANETTE continuing westbound and the MAGGIE RAE pushing up to the bank 1\/2 mile west of the bridge to facilitate their crew change. The Bridge Tender closed the bridge to allow MR BARRY's relief Pilot, Richard Harding, to drive across to the north side of the bridge. Despite having been told that the bridge was closed to vessel traffic, the MR BARRY, under the command of Hasley Prosperie, got u\/w without telling the Bridge Tender and proceeded westbound towards the Louisa Bridge. Once the relief Pilot, Richard Harding's vehicle drove across the bridge, the Bridge Tender began procedures to open the bridge. The Bridge Tender noticed that the MR BARRY was approaching and had passed the 1\/2 mile checkpoint, but had not checked in with the bridge. The Bridge Tender stated that she blew a five-whistle blast, yet the relief Pilot, Richard Harding, who was standing on the north bank of the GIWW, west of the Bridge stated that he heard only three. The Bridge Tender then radioed the MR BARRY on VHF and told him to back down because the bridge was not open yet.  The Pilot of the MR BARRY, Hasley Prosperie radioed back that he was backing down and that he would follow the bridge through as it opened towards the west.  The Bridge Tender radioed that the bridge opened to the east, i.e., toward the MR. BARRY and that he needed to back down.  Hasley Prosperie, the Pilot of the MR BARRY radioed that he was backing down. MR BARRY's barge loaded with\n propane-propylene mix struck the bridge, shearing the port and center tank\n vents and cracking the starboard tank vent allowing product to escape into the air, pluming up through the grates in the bridge, forming an explosive vapor cloud. MR BARRY's deckhands, Patrick Carlos and Daniel Duet secured all electrical power. All of MR BARRY's personnel evacuated the vessel.  The main propulsion engines secured due to lack of oxygen when the propane-propylene mix vapor reached the air intakes. The Bridge tender, Ruby Simon dialed 911 and evacuated the bridge house.  \n \n Conclusions:  \n a. In conclusion, the Pilot operated the MR BARRY negligently, resulting in his tow's allision with the Louisa Bridge.\n b. The Pilot started his approach to the bridge despite having been told by the Bridge Tender that the bridge was closed.\n c. The Pilot did not check in with the Bridge Tender after getting u\/w. \n d. The Pilot was fatigued based upon the fatigue model worksheet, scoring a fatigue index of 53.67. As per the Fatigue Investigative Addendum, any score of 50 or higher is fatigued. \n e. The pilot assumed that the bridge swung to the west, when in fact it opened towards the east. He had made numerous trips through the bridge in the past 3 years and should have known the direction the bridge swung when opening.\n f.

Crew Information:\n \n Master: \n Mate: \n Crew:  \n \n 3.  At the time of the casualty, the mate was at the helm.  A deckhand was positioned on the port bow acting as a spotter to assist the mate in maneuvering through the bridge opening.  The barge tankerman was spotting on the starboard bow.  According to the mate, the tow was traveling at an approximate speed of 3.5 knots.\n \n 4.  The empty condition of the KTC-60 presented a substantial amount of sail area for the 10-15 knot beam wind.  Slack water in Boston Harbor on September 5, 2001 occurred at 0056, approximately forty-nine (49) minutes before the casualty.  Although there is not a current measurement station in Chelsea Creek it is common local knowledge that under such circumstances the ebb current velocity is approximately one to two tenths (0.1 - 0.2) of a knot.  The mate did not indicate that the following current affected the maneuverability of his vessel.  The mate did state, however, that the wind was causing the vessel to be set to port as he was approaching the Chelsea Street Bridge.  As the vessel was proceeding through the opening, a gust of wind pushed the stern of the barge to port, causing it to rub the fendering on the south support structure for the bridge.\n \n 4.  The mate knew that that there was an exposed steel beam protruding out of the bridge support structure on the south side of the opening.  In an effort to overcome the effect of the wind, and get away from the known obstruction, he turned the wheel to starboard.  The wind continued to hold the bow to the south side of the opening so the mate held the rudder over.  When the wind gust subsided, the bow swung quickly to starboard and struck the fendering on the north support structure.  The bow rake caught an exposed girder on the fendering.\n \n 5.  After clearing the bridge opening, the mate moored the tug and barge at the TOSCO Terminal dock, East Boston, MA and notified the MSO Boston (BOSMS) watch desk.  The BOSMS Duty Marine Inspector (DMI) examined the damage and found that the impact had punctured the rake in way of the connection with the starboard side shell, leaving two (2) baseball-size holes in the steel plating approximately 2 1\/2 to 3 feet above the waterline.  A temporary epoxy patch was applied to the damaged area, and with the concurrence of the DMI and the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) surveyor, the vessel was allowed to sail to New York, NY for permanent repairs.  The KTC-60 was repaired in New York at a total cost of $8,000.\n \n 6.  When the bridge fendering system was examined by the DMI, it was confirmed (by the presence of wood fragments on the barge) that it had sustained damage from this casualty.  However, some of the damage to the fendering appeared to have been there before the allision.  Therefore, the extent of new damage caused by this casualty could not be determined. \n \n 7.  Post-casualty drug and alcohol testing was performed on all crewmembers.  \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n \n 1.  The apparent cause of the casualty was that the mate made an error in judgment when he failed to anticipate the rapid swing of the bow to starboard when a strong gust of wind from the starboard beam subsided.\n \n 2.

{"activity_id":112295,"brief":"At approximately 1630 on April 13, 2001, the M\/V FROSTY'S SLEIGH was being moored at a dock in position N26-3.0, W80-9.0, in the Intercoastal Waterway in Hollywood, Florida.  The vessel's master maneuvered the vessel to about fifteen (15) feet away from the dock in a side-to-side and backward motion by using the main control and port engine.  The master then switched from the main control to the remote control and continued to maneuver the vessel to the dock.  When the master and crew were preparing to throw a line to the dock, the starboard engine engaged into full speed forward.  The handle on the remote and main controls were in the neutral position when the starboard engine engaged.  The master tried to regain control of the vessel by moving the remote back and forward, but the engine would not respond.  The master proceeded to the main control located on the flying wing of the vessel and tried to transfer the power of the starboard engine by matching the revolution per minute (rpm), but he was unable to match the engine's rpm.  \n\nTraveling full speed forward and parallel to the dock, the M\/V FROSTY'S SLEIGH collided against the stern of the unmanned M\/V AMERICAN DREAM.  After striking and pushing the M\/V AMERICAN DREAM off the dock, the master of the M\/V FROSTY'S SLEIGH pressed the stop button for the starboard engine which was located on the main control panel at the flying bridge, successfully shutting the power to the engine.  \n\nThe forward momentum of both vessels produced by the engine and water current carried both vessels into the Intercoastal Waterway.  The M\/V FROSTY'S SLEIGH port side struck the piling of the Dania Beach drawbridge and became unengaged from the M\/V AMERICAN DREAM.  Crewmembers of the M\/V FROSTY'S SLEIGH successfully secured the vessel with a rope to the dock.  The M\/V AMERICAN DREAM drifted down the Intercoastal Waterway and sunk a few yards down the river.  Overall estimated damages exceed $1,000,000.   No injuries occurred as a result of the marine casualty.\n\nNotify Date\/Time= Apr 13 2001 @ 1700      \nInvestigator = XXXX                                 \nUnit Command = N\/A                                               \nDistrict Required? = N\nHQ Required? = N\nLast Updated in MSIS on Nov 16 2001\n\nFINDINGS:\n\n1. The M\/V Frosty's Sleigh, CG 06161, is a 122', 204 Gross Ton, British flagged, Passenger Vessel.\n2. The Frosty's Sleigh is owned by Frosty Investment Company.\n3. Weather at the time of the incident was clear with good visibility at day.  Wind was from the southeast at 10 to 15 kts, temperature was 90 degrees Fahrenheit.\n4. The vessel was on a north course at 5 knots.\n5. The vessel and crew departed Fort Lauderdale, FL on Friday, 13 April 2001 at 11:30 am. \n6. The Master was in the process of maneuvering the M\/V Frosty's Sleigh to be docked to the Martha Restaurant Dania Beach Boulevard dock.    \n7. The Master was using the remote control to maneuver the vessel into the Martha Restaurant Dania Beach Boulevard dock when the starboard engine engaged into full speed forward.  \n8. The handle on the remote and main controls was in the neutral position when the starboard engine engaged in the full speed forward. \n9. The Master tried to regain control of the vessel by moving the remote back and forward, but the engine would not respond. \n10. The Master tried to transfer the power from the port engine to the starboard engine (a standard procedure for this vessel) by using the main control on the flying wing to accelerate and balance the rotations per minute (rpm) between the two engines, but was not successful.  \n11. The Master was able to push the stop button for the starboard engine only after the vessel struck the M\/V AMERICAN DREAM, dock, and pilings of the Dania Beach Boulevard Drawbridge.\n12.  No injuries occurred as a result of the incident.  \n13. The Master moored to the dock and contacted the US Coast Guard, Hollywood police department, Florida Marine Police, and Capam Powerboat Towing Company. \n14.  A representative from the Yacht Equipment & Parts examined the various controls and determined that the remote control head failed.  There were no emergency kill switches on the remote control handles to shut off the engine promptly.  Design circuitry does not have the capability of indicating there is a fault with the system.  Transfer of station to station is only possible by matching engine revolutions per minute with the running engine and an inherent delay of twenty-two (22) seconds to transfer from the remote station to the main control station is existent.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\n1.  In accordance with XXXX, Head Marine Electrician for the Yacht Equipment and Parts Company; The cause of this incident was the result of an equipment malfunction with the remote control head.  Evidently, normal usage of the remote control head caused the wire to the controls of the starboard shift and throttle to become defective.  The defective wire intermittently caused the command circuitry to go into ahead and full throttle without the actual control head commanding this action.\n2.  There is no evidence to suggest that drugs or alcohol was a contributing factor in this casualty.  \n3.  There is no evidence of actionable misconduct, inattention to duty, negligence, or willful violation of law or regulation on the part of the licensed or certified personnel, which may have contributed to this casualty.\n\n\n"}

Assisting with this maneuver and made up to the barge's port quarter was a second  towing vessel whose job it was to pull the stern of the barge up to counteract the ebbing tide as the tow made the turn into the Creek.  After the turn was made the second towing vessel had to let go of the barge's port quarter due to a lack of safe maneuvering space.  The lead tug then had the barge alone and in an astern mode configuration abeam to an ebb tide.  Consequently, the tide set the barge down onto the fendering system.   As the lead towing vessel began to proceed forward in the Creek, the rake of the barge caught a 4\"x8\"x10' section of wood fendering cracking it.  The structural integrity of the bridge remained intact and the bridge was never closed.  There was no damage to the barge.\n\nApparent Cause:     Strong ebb tide set barge down onto fendering system.\nContributing Cause: Earlier delay moving another barge brought maneuver into ebb tide condition vice slack\n                                water as desired.\nContributing Cause:  Environmental: As described in U.S. Coast Pilot 2,p. 266 the \"currents (of the Spuyten \n                                 Duyvil Creek) are swift and erratic around the mouth of the creek.\"\nContributing Cause:  Use of the North vice South draw.  Using the South draw would have set the tow\n                                 shoreward instead of towards any bridge infrastructure.\nContributing Cause:    Second towing vessel's inability to stay on the port quarter of the barge to assist lead                       tug.\n\n\nLast Updated in MSIS on Sep  5 2001\n\n\n Note: 46 U.S.C. 6308 prohibits a Marine Casualty Investigation report from being admissible as evidence or subject to discovery in any civil or administrative proceedings, other than administrative proceedings initiated by the United States.  It also prohibits an employee, investigating the casualty, from being subjected to deposition without permission from SECDOT.\"\n"}

{"activity_id":1484363,"brief":"CASUALTY SUMMARY\nOn 06 Feb 02 at approximately 0624 EST, the M\/V AGIOS NEKTARIOS, a 738 ft. bulk freighter, allided with the McArdle Bridge fender system in Chelsea, Massachusetts.  The vessel was loaded with salt and bound for Eastern Minerals, Chelsea.  Escorting and assisting AGIOS NEKTARIOS were the four tugs MOLLY, RUSSELL JR, ALEX C, and LITTLE JOE.  Immediately prior to the allision, AGIOS NEKTARIOS suffered a loss of propulsion control while attempting to maintain position in the channel waiting for the bridge to fully open.  Neither the bridge nor its supporting structures were damaged.  Damage to the fender system was estimated at $750,000.  AGIOS NEKTARIOS suffered minor scrapes along its stern.\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n1.\tAGIOS NEKTARIOS began its transit from anchorage in Broad Sound at approximately 0330 on 06 Feb 02, bound for the Eastern Minerals Terminal, on the north side of the Chelsea River, immediately upriver from the Meridian Street (McArdle) Bridge (Evidence #6 and #8).\n2.\tAll required equipment, including the vessel's propulsion plant, was tested and found satisfactory in accordance with US regulations 12 hours prior to transit (Evidence #3, #6).\n3.\tWeather for the transit was as anticipated; light and variable winds, clear visibility, rising tide with negligible tidal current.  Sunrise was at 0653 ET.\n4.\tAGIOS NEKTARIOS is a single screw, bulk freighter with a 106 ft beam.  It was carrying approximately 55,000 LT of road salt.  During the transit, the vessel's draft was 38.5 ft (Evidence #1, #8)\n5.\tBoston Harbor Pilot boarded the AGIOS NEKTARIOS at 0340 as it approached Boston Harbor.  After a brief discussion with the master, Captain assumed the watch and proceeded inbound, escorted by the four tugs MOLLY, RUSSELL JR, ALEX C, and LITTLE JOE (Evidence #6 and #8).\n6.\tCaptain holds a valid, sixth issue, USCG Merchant Mariner License for a Master, Steam or Motor Vessel of any gross tons upon oceans, with endorsements for First Class Pilot that allows for pilotage of vessels of any gross tons for Boston Harbor, Mystic River, Chelsea River, Town River, Fore River, the Narrows and Nantasket Roads from the LNB to Braintree, Salem Harbor, and Salem Sound .  Due to the fact that the AGIOS NEKTARIOS is a foreign vessel on a foreign voyage, the services of a Federal First Class Pilot were not required by law or regulation (46 U.S.C 8502 and 46 CFR 15812).  Captain has held a Full Branch Pilot Commission, issued by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, since 1999.  On 06 Feb 02, while Captain was onboard the AGIOS NEKTARIOS he was acting under the authority of his state issued credentials.\n7.\tMOLLY, RUSSELL JR, ALEX C, and LITTLE JOE are owned and operated by Bay State Towing Company in East Boston, Massachusetts.  The tug particulars are as follows (Evidence #9):\n\tLength (ft)\tDisp (GT)\tHorsepower\n\tMOLLY:\t99.5\t196\t2750\n\tRUSSELL JR:\t104.1\t195\t1000\n\tALEX C:\t96.3\t192\t2450\n\tLITTLE JOE:\t80.4\t175\t3600\t\t\n8.\tAt 0532 Docking Master Captain XXXXXXX XXXXXX arrived onboard the AGIOS NEKTARIOS (Evidence #6, #7).\n9.\tCaptain XXXXXX is licensed to serve as the following:  Master of Ocean Steam or Motor Vessels of not more than 1600 gross tons; Radar Observer Unlimited; also, Chief Mate of Ocean Steam or Motor Vessels of any gross tons; First Class Pilot of vessels of any gross tons upon the waters of Boston Harbor from Deer Island Light to and including Chelsea and Mystic Rivers; Weymouth Fore River and Town River from Germantown Point to the Head of Navigation.  Captain XXXXXX was onboard the AGIOS NEKTARIOS and acting in the capacity of Docking Master to assist in the bridge transit and mooring evolution on 06 Feb 02.  His holding of a First Class Pilot license endorsement is a condition of his employment and a condition of his being contracted by Ilios Shipping.  Since 46 CFR 15.610 requires anyone controlling the movement of any uninspected towing vessel to hold an Operator Uninspected Towing Vessel license (or acceptable equivalent as defined by 46 CFR 15.910), Captain XXXXXX was operating under the authority of his Coast Guard Merchant Mariner License.\n10.\tAt 0535 AGIOS NEKTARIOS proceeded inbound Boston Harbor with the RUSSELL JR. and the LITTLE JOE made fast forward, with the ALEX C. and the MOLLY trailing (Evidence #6).\n11.\tCaptain XXXXXX relieved Captain XXXXXX when the AGIOS NEKTARIOS was approximately abreast of the U.S. Coast Guard facility at 455 Commercial Street.\n12.\tAt 0600 AGIOS NEKTARIOS arrived at the turning basin off of the Chelsea Terminal Limited Partnership pier. The tug MOLLY was made fast to the stern of the vessel and the ALEX C was stationed off the port quarter. The vessel started its turn by bringing the bow toward the Tobin Bridge and using the ALEX C on the port quarter to push the stern around. After the vessel was in position to proceed astern, the ALEX C moved around to the starboard quarter to help stop the swing of the ship and the tug MOLLY was used to tow the AGIOS NEKTARIOS astern.\n13.\tAt 0606 the engine order was slow ahead as the AGIOS NEKTARIOS moved toward the McArdle Bridge. The engine was responding normally at this time (Evidence #6).\n14.\tHigh tide for the morning was at 0609.  At the time of the allision, the height of the water was 9.99 ft above MLLW (Evidence #6).\n15.\tAt 0610\tthe engine was ordered all stop. Captain XXXXXX made a call to the McArdle Bridge on VHF radio channel 13 to request an opening. The bridge operator acknowledged the request and made preparations for opening. At this time buoy no. 16 was off of the port quarter of the AGIOS NEKTARIOS and the vessel was proceeding towards the McArdle Bridge at approximately 1 knot. The tugs were in the same arrangement as before (Evidence #3, #6, #13).\n16.\tAt 0615 the McArdle Bridge was not open or opening, according to Captain XXXXXX and Captain XXXXX XXXXXXXXX, master of the MOLLY. Dead slow ahead was ordered by Captain XXXXXX onboard the AGIOS NEKTARIOS. The vessel's engine did not respond. The Master of the vessel was investigating the cause of the failure and was in contact with the Chief Engineer (Evidence #3, #6).\n17.\tAt 0617 the south leaf of the McArdle Bridge was open but the north leaf remained in the down position, as stated by Captain XXXXX and Captain XXXXXX. Captain XXXXXX ordered full ahead. There was still no response from the engine (Evidence #6).\n18.\tShortly after the 0617 command for full ahead, Captain XXXXXX notified Captain XXXXXX that the engine was not responding.  Captain XXXXXX indicated that he was aware of the failure (Evidence #8).\n19.\tAs AGIOS NEKTARIOS neared the bridge, the tug MOLLY cleared the stern of the AGIOS NEKTARIOS and moved off to the East Boston (south) side of the Chelsea River to avoid striking the McArdle Bridge.\n20.\tAt approximately 0622, Captain XXXXXX contacted McArdle Bridge via channel 13 and advised personnel to clear the bridge (Evidence #8).  Bridge operators and workers stated that immediately following Captain XXXXXX's warning they left the bridge, which had been operating properly until their departure (Evidence #12).\n21.\tAt 0623 Captain XXXXXXX determined the bow tugs were clear of the anchors, and then ordered both the port and starboard anchor to be let go (Evidence #6).\n22.\tAt 0624 the stern of the AGIOS NEKTARIOS came in contact with the fender system of the Chelsea side of the McArdle Bridge and also ran aground in the mud on the Chelsea side of the Chelsea River. The stern of the vessel penetrated the fender system, bending the fender system into a V shape (Evidence #1, #2, #3, #12).\n23.\tAfter the vessel came to rest, the anchors were weighed and AGIOS NEKTARIOS was pulled from the fender system by the tugs. Once the McArdle Bridge was completely opened, the AGIOS NEKTARIOS proceeded as normal to the Eastern Mineral pier and docked without further incident.\n24.\tFollowing the incident, the chief engineer surveyed and cleaned the starting air pilot valve.  The starting air system was restored and operationally tested with the engine ahead and astern.  Both the starting air system and the engine operated satisfactorily (Evidence #15).\n25.\tAfter returning to the Bay State Towing dock (Pier 1, East Boston), Captain XXXXXX and each of the tug captains submitted to alcohol and drug testing.  The watchstanders on the AGIOS NEKTARIOS submitted to alcohol testing after mooring the vessel.  All results were XXXXXXXX for both alcohol and drugs (Evidence #5 and #17). Although the agent and owner's representative were reminded by the OCMI of their responsibility to determine the need and provide chemical testing (Evidence #16), the watchstanding crew of the AGIOS NEKTARIOS was not tested for drugs. \n26.\tCoast Guard inspectors and ABS surveyors attended the vessel at the pier to determine the extent of damage.  Minor scrapes were noted along the vessel's stern, with no inset or structural damage reported (Evidence #15).  Northeast Diving Services of Newport, RI conducted an underwater survey of the hull and running gear and reported no apparent damage (Evidence #14).\n27.\tDamage to the McArdle Bridge fender system is estimated at $580,247.83 (Evidence #18).\n28.           The McArdle Bridge just finished a 20 month refurbishment project. The project required a 4 hour notification for bridge opening. 05 FEB 02 was the first day of \"normal\" operation. In preparation, XXXXX XXXXX initiated a telephonic conversation with Captain XXXXXX on 04 FEB 02 to inform him of the bridge status that it would \"open on demand\" 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (Evidence #11).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n1.\tThe apparent cause of this casualty was engine failure, most probably attributable to an unexpected failure of the starting air pilot valve (Facts 16-18, 24).\n2.\tContributing causes include; (1) Human error on the part of Captain XXXXXX XXXXXX, (2) Accepted practice within the port of closely approaching bridges while awaiting opening, (3) Lack of formal policy and procedure for McArdle Bridge opening requests and responses (4) Poor communication between McArdle Bridge operators and Captain XXXXXX.\n3.\tThere is evidence of error in judgment on the part of Captain XXXXX.  Although Captain XXXXX was aware that this was the first time the McArdle Bridge was available for immediate opening after extensive construction, having discussed the necessity for ample advance notice with the Superintendent of Bridges for the City of Boston, XXXXX XXXXX, and despite having repeated difficulty with the bridge in previous transits, he did not request an opening until 0610, 14 minutes prior to the allision.  Captain XXXXX also failed to confirm the status of the bridge with its operators at any point during his approach, assuming it would be open upon his arrival.  He relied solely on the ship's propulsion system as a means of checking his way in the event of encountering the bridge closed.   Finally, Captain XXXXX did not take sufficiently early and appropriate action to avoid allision with the bridge or its fenders.  The initial order to slow the vessel's sternway was given at 0615, with no response from the engine.  None of the four assist tugs present were used to stop the vessel, and the anchors were not let go until 0623, one minute prior to striking the fender system.  (Facts 10, 15-18, 21, 22)\n4.\tThere is evidence of a violation of 46 CFR 4.06-1 on the part of the agent and owner's representative, Paralia Corporation in that the crew of the AGIOS NEKTARIOS was not tested for drugs following a serious marine incident.  (Fact 25)\n5.\tThere is no evidence of actionable misconduct, negligence, inattention to duty or willful violation of law or regulation on the part of the Boston Harbor Pilot or on the part of any of the operators or crew of the assist tugs.\n6.\tThere is no evidence of actionable misconduct, negligence, inattention to duty or willful violation of law or regulation on the part of any person of the United States Coast Guard, or any other government agency, contributing to this incident.  There is no evidence that the use of alcohol or drugs contributed to this casualty. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n1.\tThat the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, initiate a dialogue with the Boston Harbor Pilot's Association, local operators, the City of Boston, the Massachusetts Highway Department, and other interested parties to formalize deep draft vessel transit procedures for drawbridges in the Boston Zone and to review current assist tug practices, procedures, and contingencies. (Conclusions 2, 3)\n2.\tThat the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection initiate a Marine Violation investigation regarding the failure of the AGIOS NEKTARIOS owner's representative to provide drug testing for crewmembers directly involved in a Serious Marine Incident (Conclusion 4)\t\n3.\tThat this case be closed.\n"}
{"activity_id":1485807,"brief":"UTV SHEILA MORAN was undocking the barge SUMERSET from Lyon Shipyard in Norfolk, VA.  The SUMERSET is a 500 foot by 105 foot freight barge and was empty, resulting in siginificant freeboard and a shallow draft.  The barge was moored port side to the pier with the bow facing the left descending bank.   The barge was to be undocked and proceed west to the Perdue facility on the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River.  \n\nThe SHEILA MORAN was in the notch of the barge and the UTV CAVALIER was assisting, made up port side to the barge's starboard side, with a bow line on the barge's #2 cleat and stern line to the #3 cleat.  The tide was flooding and winds were WNW at 20 knots.  \n\nThe barge was backed out by the SHEILA MORAN.  When the bow of the barge cleared obstructions along the river bank, the master of the SHEILA MORAN instructed the CAVALIER to let go the stern line and to back down, maintaining a 90 degree angle with the tow to swing the bow west into the channel.  The master split the throttles on the SHEILA MORAN, port forward and starboard reverse, planning to swing the bow of the barge west into the channel with the assistance of the CAVALIER.  \n\nThe barge swung to starboard until it was approximately at a 45 degree angle to the channel, with the bow facing southwest.  The tide and wind began to set the vessels east toward the nearby Campostella Bridge.  The CAVALIER and SHEILA MORAN were unable to complete turning the barge into the channel.  The master of the SHEILA MORAN ordered the barge's anchor dropped, but the anchor was unable to hold the tow against the flood tide and wind.  The tow continued to be set east until the port quarter of the SHEILA MORAN allided with the fendering system of the Campostella Bridge at 0440L.  The master of the SHEILA MORAN then requested an additional assist tug from Moran Twoing.  \n\nAt 0510L the UTV GREG TURECAMO arrived and made up to the starboard bow of the barge and began aligning it in the channel.  At 0515L, the tow was properly aligned in the channel and free from the bridge fendering system.  The barge was towed to the Perdue facility and was moored at 0815L.   The bridge sustained an estimated $95,000 in damage to the fendering system.  There was no damage to the bridge structure or any of the vessels involved.     \n\nThere were no mechanical or failures or equipment factors contributing to this casualty.  Drugs, alcohol and fatique were not factors.\n\nThe  cause of this allision was the failure of the master of the SHEILA MORAN to properly plan the undocking maneuver.  Specifically, he underestimated the difficulty of maneuvering the 500 foot barge in close proximity to the bridge, which was just upstream.  He also underestimated the effect of the wind and tide on the high freeboard and shallow draft of the barge.  \n\nContributing to this casualty was the failure to use a second assist tug."}

{"activity_id":1492743,"brief":"Passenger vessel SS INDEPENDENCE was being towed dead-ship from Pier-50, San Francisco, to Anchorage 26 (location for MARAD Reserve Fleet of ships).  Three tugs were assigned for towing, and a Pilot hired for the transit.  Weather conditions were nominal.  The transit was uneventful until approaching the Carquinez Bridge.  The ship Master initiated an inquiry to the pilot regarding the air draft clearance with the Bridge.  The pilot stated the maximum clearance was 135 feet, who then asked the master what the INDEPENDENCE air draft was.  The master didn't know the entire air draft, but said the height-of-eye pilot house level was 85 feet.  The transit continued.\n\nAt approximately 1045 the upper portion of the ship foremast allided with the Carquinez Bridge, breaking off about 20 feet; the broken section remained suspended amongst the rigging.  The MARAD Project Manager later estimated the actual strike took place 7 feet down from the mast top.  Upon recognizing the lessened air draft was still too great to safely clear the next bridge along the transit (Union Pacific Railroad Bridge), the ship was returned to Pier-50.  The Carquinez Bridge tidal conditions during the incident was approximately 2.5 feet above MLLW, thus even a transit conducted at low tide would have resulted in a similar incident.

{"activity_id":1494861,"brief":"SUMMARY\n\nAt 0715 on Monday, March 18, 2002 the M\/V CHARLIE EVERHART, O.N. 534782 was underway at Mile 190.5 of the Cumberland River (CBR).  The \"M\/V CHARLIE EVERHART\" was pushing six total freight barges in a two wide and three long arrangement, down river with a very strong current on her stern. The weather was poor with wind and heavy rain but fair visibility. All barges were empty at the time of the incident. While attempting pass under the CSX railroad bridge also known as the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Bridge in the preferred channel (right descending side), the starboard lead barge, \"ING 732\" struck the right descending bank bridge pier. \n\nBM1 XXX XXXXXXX, CG MSD Nashville arrived onboard the then moored \"M\/V CHARLIE EVERHART\" at 0900 on the same day to conduct an initial investigation.  The vessel captain, and person in charge at the time of the incident was Mr. XXXXX XXXXX, CG License XXXXXX, issued 14 July 2000 at Memphis, Tennessee. During his interview with BM1 XXXXXXX and his submitted CG-2692, Report of Marine Accident, Injury or Death, Captain XXXXX reported his speed at 1.5 knots; his tow was 677' total length and 70' wide. The Cumberland River was flowing at an estimated 10 miles per hour. During his approach to the subject bridge, a deckhand was on the bow of the \"ING 732\" dewatering the bow void, which had some rainwater in it, and at the same time he was on a portable radio reporting distance to the bridge pier.  Captain XXXXX stated he was flanking, attempting pass under the bridge, and his last report from the deckhand was 150 feet to the bridge pier, and immediately after that report the \"ING 732\" struck the bridge pier. The current of the river immediately pushed the \"M\/V CHARLIE EVERHART\" with her tow intact to port. The entire tow pivoted on the bridge pier and came to rest against the three bridge piers, with the stern of the \"M\/V CHARLIE EVERHART\" against the left descending bank and her tow blocking the entire channel. Captain XXXXX immediately contacted his operations office that in turn dispatched the \"M\/V L.B. EDGIN\" and  \"M\/V TRACY K\" to assist and reported the incident to CG Group Ohio Valley who in turn reported it to this office.\n\nThe \"M\/V TRACY K\" and \"M\/V L.B. EDGIN\" arrived from the down river side (against the current) and tied off to the forward and stern barges on the port side of the tow at the same time the M\/V CHARLIE EVERHART managed to maneuver to the starboard side of the center barge. The barges where then pushed off the bridge piers using all three barges, the pivoted to line back up with the right descending channel. The \"M\/V TRACY K\" made fast to the bow of the tow and with the \"M\/V CHARLIE EVERHART\" made fast to the stern the tow was brought through the span and then moored to federal mooring cells on the down river side of the bridge. A damage survey was completed on all the barges with the only damage noted top the bow of the \"ING 723\". \n\nIn a written statement Mr. XXXX X. XXXXXXXXX writes that he was onboard performing the duties of the senior deckhand. Mr. XXXXXXXXX was dewatering the bow void of the \"ING 732\" and at the same time giving the captain distances to the bridge. He moved from the lead starboard barge to the center barge and that is when he realized they where going to hit the span hard and he sought shelter by holding on to the combing of the cargo containment on the center starboard barge. After the allision he saw the downriver lead barge brake a facing wire, he ran and secured the barge with a mooring line and then was called by radio to return to the \"M\/V CHARLIE EVERHART\" to replace another facing wire that had broken.\n\nIn a written statement Mr. XXXXXX X. XXXXXXXX, CG License #XXXXXX was onboard performing the duties of the pilot. He states that the Captain XXXXX was communicating with his senior deckhand with regard to distance to the bridge pier and the last report he heard on the radio was the barge still had 150' distance to the pier that was the last report before the barge struck the pier.\n\nIn a telephone conversation between Mr. XXXX XXXXX, Regional Engineer for Structures with CSX Railroad and CWO XXX XXXXXXXXXX on 27 March 2002, Mr. XXXXX stated that the damage to the number one bridge pier was minimal. Their office inspected the bridge on the day of the allision and at most a couple of stones on the pier structure will have to be replaced. He estimated damage to the bridge at approximately $2000.00.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n1. The primary casual factor appears to stem from inaccurate reports from the senior deckhand bow-watch to the master of the vessel during the unusually high river current and flows.\n\n2. Coast Guard Group Ohio Valley received immediate notification of the allision and the responsible party took immediate and decisive action to clear the channel and secure the tow.\n\n3. In the opinion of this investigating officer the master is at fault for the allision. However, due to the river current and poor visibility during the event, this investigating officer recommends no administrative action against the vessel captain is warranted.\n\nNo evidence exists to suggest inattention to duty or actionable misconduct on the part of the licensed master. This Investigating Officer recommends case closed. \n \n\n                                                        CWO X.X. XXXXXXXXXX\n                                                        BM1  X.

The Highway 90 bridge struck the UTV at the upperdeck rail, then tore the roof flashing back as the vessel maneuvered around the closing bridge. In addition to damage to rail and flashing, electronic cables were severed, and pilothouse damaged.  The apparent cause was human error in that the bridge tender failed to wait for all clear signal from the vessel, failed to monitor the radio until the vessel was clear, or to visually verify the vessel was clear prior to closing the bridge.  Root cause was failure of the bridge tender to ensure safe operation of the bridge.

Long Bridge has a vertical clearance of 153.0' minus the Carrollton Gage, which at the time had a reading of 15.3', which provided for a clearance of 137.6', which should leave over 5\" of clearance above the ship.\n\nAs the vessel passed under the Bridge, approximately 2\" - 4\" of the radio direction finder antenna scraped the bottom of the bridge, causing no damage to the bridge.  The RDF was no longer used by the ship and was inoperable prior to this incident.\n\nThe cause of this incident was Human Error \/ miscalculation of the vessel's air draft."}

{"activity_id":1629798,"brief":"On 02 June 2002, at approximately 0420, the M\/V JACK FLAHAUT was southbound on the Missouri River (MI 448) with four barges in tow.  The pilot reported that as the tow was passing through the bridge, the lead starboard barge (MEM 5230) struck the protection cell of the St. Joseph Railroad Bridge.  In accordance with company policy, pilot was tested for drugs and alcohol.  Barge MEM 5230 sustained damage to the bow rake which caused water to leak into the cargo space.  The bow rake was reportedly caved in past the cargo box.  The company made arrangements for another barge to be brought in to offload the cargo from the MEM 5230.  There was no damage to the cargo, however, the cost of transferring the cargo to another barge was estimated at $36,000.  The company estimates the cost of repairs to the bow rake at $60,000.  Two other barges (MEM 94157 and MPC 32) sustained minor damage as a result of the incident.  Both barges were damaged after the MEM 5230 bounced off the protection cell and pushed into the other barges in the tow.  Both barges sustained the same damage; minor dents in the #2 wing tanks.  The estimated cost of repairs for both #2 wing tanks is $4000 ($2000 each).   Because the damage is considered minor and does not affect the structural integrity of the barges, the company may decided not to repair the damages on both the MEM 94157 and the MPC 32.\n"}

The licensed Captain of the vessel was on board but was not on the bridge at the time of the incident.  The dimensions of the tow were 450 feet long x 75 feet wide.  According to Chart 11365, the horizontal clearance of the waterway beneath the bridge was 77 feet after the bridge is swung open.  The operator was in communication with the bridge attendant during the approach.  The attendant informed the operator that vessels over 70 feet wide cannot pass through, which he apparently did not understand; when the attendant informed him that the bridge was all the way open, he still attempted to pass through with his 75-foot wide tow.  When the tow was approximately 40 feet from the bridge, the attendant contacted the operator again and instructed him not to enter because the tow looked too wide.  As the operator of the tug backed the engines down, the tow struck the piling next to the bridge and they broke.

{"activity_id":1694320,"brief":"At 2130LCL, received notification via MSO that the M\/V Marinette, while down bound on the Menominee River,  under bow and stern tow, had allided with the Ogden Street Bridge.  By way of Station Sturgeon Bay small boat, MSD investigators responded to the vessel which was at anchor approximately 3 NM NE of the entrance to Menominee River.  Initial inspection of the vessel revealed only superficial damage including an inset of 24\" by 6\" to the bulwark of the port bow and paint scraping to the outboard overhead just below the starboard boat deck (see Evidence).\n\nDuring an interview, the M\/V Marinette's master stated that upon approaching the bridge, the M\/V Marinette was lined up with the opening.  But as the M\/V Marinette neared, a strong current set the vessel to the north of opening.  Both tow vessels were then ordered by the Pilot, to pull to the south.  The pilot then came ahead to avoid grounding at port quarter.  The vessel continued to be set north and at 2056LCL contacted the northwest section of the bridge.  Since the tugs were pulling strongly to the south, the vessel then headed south and at 2058LCL contacted the bridge tender house located on the southeast section of the bridge.  The M\/V Marinette then continued down river and at 2101 was released from tow.  The master also stated that this was his first transit of this river during the night and that, as a result of this incident, he had no intention of conducting a night transit in the future.\n\nInvestigators then proceeded to the bridge to assess damage.  Initial inspection revealed moderate damage to a concrete structure on the northwest section of the bridge and damage to the roof overhang of the bridge tender's house on the southeast section of the bridge (see Evidence).  Wisconsin Department of Transportation damage assessments estimated approximately $60,000 of damage had occurred.  No injuries or pollution occurred.\n\nDuring an interview of the operator of the forward tow Tug Carla Anne Selvick, he stated that he had noticed no problems with navigating his vessel down river.  He also stated he had noted no difficulties with communication with the other vessels and that all maneuvering orders were being given by the pilot on board the M\/V Marinette.  Upon approaching the bridge, he stated, that he was ordered to proceed straight as the tow was then lined up with the bridge passage.  Upon entering the passage, he was ordered to pull south.  But, due to being within the passage, he was unable to pull south until his tug had cleared the bridge.  He further stated that he had only transited the river at night approximately twice before.\n\nDuring an interview of the operator of the stern tow Tug Jacquelyn Nicole,  he stated he had made multiple routine maneuvers with his vessel throughout the tow to compensate for the disturbance created by the M\/V Marinette's maneuvering.  He also stated that there had been no difficulties with the tow prior to the allision.  He further stated he believed current to be the reason the M\/V Marinette had been set.\n\nDuring an interview with the master, he stated that at approximately one boat length before reaching the bridge passage that the M\/V Marinette was lined up for the passage.  He also stated that there had been no difficulties with communication with the other vessels and that there had been no difficulties with the tow prior to the M\/V Marinette being set and alliding with the bridge.  He further stated that upon the vessel being set to the north, he brought the M\/V Marinette ahead to avoid grounding at the port quarter and to use bridge fendering system to aid in turning the vessel.  But, due to the flare of the vessel's bow, the M\/V Marinette also contacted a concrete structure on the northwest section of the bridge.  He also stated that upon the vessel being set to the north, he ordered the tow vessel to pull to the south.  He further stated that he had only one prior transit of this area during the night.\n\nCause of the casualty was determined to be unforeseen marine conditions, a northerly current in vicinity of the bridge, that all parties were unable to respond to in such time as to avoid the allision.  A loss of situational awareness, on the part of the pilot, with regards to the location of the tow vessels, and lack of experience with night transits of this area, were contributing factors."}

Vessel was transiting inbound Greens Bayou from Megafleet to Walton's Terminal at time of allision.  Encl (1) & (5).  Person operating vessel at the time is currently on the 7th issue of his license & has never had any disciplinary action taken against his merchant mariner credentials (MMC) by the Coast Guard.  He has no record of any prior marine casualties or incidents in MISLE.  Encl (6) & (7).\n\nOperator advised that the bridge tender raised the vertical lift railroad bridge all the way up a few minutes before the allision, which we verified w\/ the bridge tender.  Encl (9).  As the bridge was being raised, he began jacking down the hydraulic lift wheelhouse, which was fully extended so that he could see over the barge he was pushing.  UTV MR VANCE was approx 1000' from the bridge at this time & was \"drifting\" w\/ the tide\/current towards the bridge (engines idling).  The current was approx 2 knots running north, i.e. towards the bridge, w\/ winds blowing approx 5mph in the same direction.  The wheelhouse started to lower but then suddenly stopped.  Captain tried to go full astern but it was too late as the wheelhouse allided w\/ the underside of the bridge.  Encl (1).  Captain explained that he did not lower the wheelhouse any sooner b\/c he needed to maintain maximum range of vision over the barge he was pushing for as long a time as possible to ensure a safe transit under the bridge.  It is essentially a matter of timing to lower the wheelhouse at the last possible moment in order to safely complete this evolution, which the Captain had successfully completed many times before w\/out incident over the past couple years he has been on the UTV MR VANCE.  \n\nAccording to the Captain, there were never any problems w\/the wheelhouse before this incident, so it surprised him that it failed so suddenly & at such an inopportune time.  In fact, the wheelhouse raised\/lowered properly earlier in the day when UTV MR VANCE passed under the same bridge, pushing the same barge (except it was empty), outbound Greens Bayou @ approx 0900.  Encl (9).\n\nCaptain advised that, when fully extended, the wheelhouse is approx 28' above the deck of the UTV.  Based on measurements we took after the incident, large steel hopper covers were stacked 12.5' high above main deck of the barge, fore & aft.  Combined w\/ freeboard above 8' draft of loaded barge, the covers were approx 20' above the water line at the time of the incident (20' estimate verified by crewmember on UTV who observed covers while they were pushing barge).  \n\nThese hopper covers created an obvious obstruction to UTV's line of sight, causing Captain to jack up wheelhouse as high as it could go in order to see above barge as he pushed it.  Captain advised that he prefers to maintain, if possible, at least 5' of clearance above barges he pushes in order to ensure a full range of vision.  \n\nThe steel pipe in the hopper of the barge was not loaded in such a manner as to prevent hopper covers from being secured in place prior to transit; however, the crew who loaded barge left the covers stacked on the deck instead of securing them in place.  This essentially resulted in an additional 12.5' of vertical obstruction for Captain."}

The Captain further states that the Pilot was lined up nicely, but that the vessel was simply overcome by the wind and current, and there was nothing that could have been done differently in the maneuver.  There was obviously a good deal of miscommunication on the bridge just prior to the allision (question as to speed of the vessel, which guide wall to line up on, and who was in command of the vessel's movement).\n\nThe Captain stated that this bridge is dangerous because of cross-currents and wind, and recommends that the guide walls be extended in order to make transit easier.\n\nPost-casualty drug and alcohol testing was done after this incident."}

The port bow of the lead tank barge, GBL 430, allided with the support pillar located on the west span on the Harrisburg Highway Swing Bridge as it entered the west bridge span.  As a result of the allision, the tank barge GBL 430 sustained approximately 20K in damage to its port bow headlog and rake knuckle.  A CG-835 was issued requiring the GBL 430 to be repaired by 11 December 2002.   The second tank barge, GBL 330, and the tug BARBARA TAYLOR sustained no damage as a result of the allision.  A representative from the Louisiana State Highway Department inspected the bridge and found no damage.  No pollution, injuries or further damage occurred.   \n\n   The operator, stated he transited this area over thirty times in the past year without incident.  \n\nApparent Cause:\n   The apparent cause of the allision was high winds from a strong storm front which passed through the area at the time of the incident.  The high winds associated with the front set the stern of the vessel to starboard which in turn caused the bow of the lead barge to turn to port and strike the bridge support pillar.  The operator was unable to stop the vessels forward momentum or the vessels swing towards the support pillar in order to prevent the allision."}

During the transit through the bridge the MARY P's rub rail struck a navigational light that was attached to the fendering system on the bridge. As a result, the light was cracked at the base and was no longer operational. The master of the vessel immediately agreed to pay for the damage and the light was subsequently repaired.\n\nOn 11\/06\/02 at 0945 during high tide the barge struck a different navigational light attached to the fendering system snapping it at its base. The master of the vessel again paid for the light and it was subsequently repaired.\n\nOn 12\/04\/02 the barge struck the fendering system and damaged a sign. The sign marked a submerged cable \nand the sign was submerged at the time it was struck. The sign was attached to the outside portion of the fender system.\n\nOn 12\/05\/02 MSO Boston Investigator attended the bridge to check for damage. Photographs of the light placement were taken and the bridge operator was interviewed. The bridge operator stated that the barge was very wide with 6 inches of clearance on either side. The waterway is dramatically restricted at the BLYNMAN Bridge, producing a 3 kt current. While transiting the bridge, the barge was supported by two vessels, one fore and one aft. The bridge operator stated that the operators always transited slowly and were very concerned when they damaged the lights. MSO Boston received a fax from  Massachusetts Bridges and Highways division, detailing the allisions. Received CG-2692's for all allisions from the Fore River Dock & Dredge, Inc. The dredge work has since been completed and the barge MARY P will no longer be transiting the bridge.\n\nConclusions\nThe  placement of the lights and sign on the bridge appear to be the primary reason that any damage occurred. If the lights and sign were placed further back from the bridge the barge would never have touched them. The size of the barge (36.1ft w) combined with the width of the bridge (39ft) and the current made it almost impossible for the barge to get through the bridge without touching. The barge operator appeared to use all possible means to avoid the allision, including using a vessel on either end of the barge. The operator of the barge willingly admitted to the incidents and readily paid for the replacement of the lights.\n\nRecommend that the Captain of the Port initiate an examination of the BLYNMAN Bridge in conjunction with the Massachusetts State Highway department; specifically to address the placement of the navigation lights, hazard markings, and the maximum width of vessels allowed through the bridge. MSO Boston Waterways division and the State Highway department are working on making changes.\n\nRecommend this activity be closed, no further agency action required."}

The operator of the UTV stated that while passing through the bridge the cross current caused by eddies from the high-rise bridge suddenly caused the bow of the barge to sheer to port resulting in the barge rubbing the fendering system of the bridge .  The operator made attempts to avoid making contact with the bridge but rubbed the fendering system. The operator observe no damage to the bridge.

There are strong currents, eddies caused by the high-rise bridge to the east and the old US 1 bridge to the west.  The three bridges are in close proximity (approx 250 yds apart) and aligned and in such a position that vessels must turn while passing through the three bridges.

When the operator, XXXX attempted to straighten out his tow, he was unable to control the vessel and struck the RDB with barge CC95102 and the vessel.  The subsequent grounding broke away several mooring wires causing the first fifteen barges directly in front of the M\/V JOSEPH PATRICK ECKSTIEN to break away.  The forward fifteen barges remained together at that time.  Mr. XXXX reported the breakaway over the radio to all vessels in the immediate area to assist.  Five tugs from Riverway arrived on-scene within minutes and started to gather the drifting barges.  The M\/V JOSEPH PATRICK ECKSTIEN proceeded to push the remaining fifteen barges through the JB Bridge and attempted to tie them along side the dolphins directly below the bridge.  During the attempt to moor the remaining barges, the mooring wires started to break away and as a result the remaining fifteen barges were also set adrift.  Vessels in the area responded and were able to gather up all drifting barges without incident.\n\nCWO XXXX and MK2 XXXX, MSO ST.

There were no other barges damaged.  Upon investigation of the abutment to the JB Bridge, it was apparent that the bridge had been struck by one of the adrift barges.  There was little damage to the abutment, mostly cosmetic damage to the concrete facing to the abutment (photos attached to the case file).  The master of the M\/V JOSEPH PATRICK ECKSTIEN stated that he did not see any barges hit the bridge, but acknowledged that he did not see every barge transit through the bridge.  The investigation to the barges damaged indicates the barge CC-7927 struck the abutment.  There was heavy damage to the port corner of the bow rake that is indicative to the damage that would have occurred by striking the bridge.\n\nIt is the opinion of this investigator that the cause of the grounding and subsequent break away is a result of low water conditions in the UMR and operator error on the part of Mr. XXXX  There are indication that the three buoys directly north of the JB Bridge are missing which could have been a factor to the grounding, however the fact that the river stage was at a negative 2.3 at the time of the grounding, the master of the M\/V JOSEPH PATRICK ECKSTIEN should have exercised more caution when operating in an area with missing aids."}

The Tug operator had lined the barge up on the North west side of the bridge and was slowly moving forward when he attempted to actuate the barge's bow thruster to push the barge away from the Northwest side but inadvertently energized the bow thruster in the wrong direction.  This pushed the barge to the starboard  into the fender system.  Once operator realized he had actuated the bow thruster in the wrong direction he shifted it to the port and put the tug in reverse in an attempt to minimize the impact to the fenders and bridge.

{"activity_id":1723366,"brief":"Incident Brief:\n\nOn 28Jun02, a 12-barge fleet of barges was moored at the Upper River Services Dakota Barge Fleet located at MM 836.2 on the UMR.  The barges were tied together awaiting a towboat for transit south down the river.\n\nAt approximately 1315 local time, the UTV ITASCA received a call stating that the above referenced string of barges had broken away from its mooring and was drifting south toward the Pig's Eye Railroad Bridge (located at MM 835.7 on the UMR).  Also, around the same time the UTV KATHY ELLEN w\/11-barge tow, was spotted transiting north through the section of the Mississippi River that runs adjacent to the downtown St. Paul Airport (approx UMR mile 838). \n\nIn response to the breakaway call, Upper River Services (URS) dispatched all of their available towboats (6-total) to the scene for recovery operations.  The UTV ITASCA was the first to arrive on-scene.  The crew of the ITASCA reported that the fleet of barges bounced off the right descending bank and continued down river until landing broadside against the Pig's Eye Railroad Bridge's northern protection cell.  Six of the barges then broke off from the tow and came to rest against the left descending bank on the north side of the railroad bridge.  The remaining six barges remained perpendicular (blocking the entire river) with the Freight Barge AGS 943 (originally the port lead barge in the string) resting against the bridge's protection cell. \n\nUSCG Group Upper Mississippi River issued an urgent notice to mariners informing boat traffic of the river blockage at 1715 local time.  Investigators from MSD St. Paul arrived on scene around that time and enacted an emergency river closure at the Pig's Eye RR Bridge.  Members from the CG Auxiliary arrived on-scene at 1750 and helped to enforce the closure, which affected numerous recreational vessels and a couple small passenger vessels.  The closure was in effect until approx 1830 (local).\n\nURS personnel responded quickly and commenced barge recovery operations.  The AGS 943 sustained severe damage to the port side amidships shell plating and was taking on water.  Several pumps were installed and the barge was eventually dewatered to a point that allowed for recovery off of the bridge protection cell.  The 6-barges resting perpendicular in the channel were recovered first and the channel was cleared and reopened by 1830.  Recovery operations then shifted to the barges along the left descending bank and the scene was wrapped up at 2020.  \n\nPost accident analysis revealed that a port deck fitting on the stern of the Freight Barge AGS 967 failed.  Prior to the incident, the fitting had been the point where the aft end of the 12-barge string was secured to the mooring lines.  The fitting subsequently ended up bent at a 90-degree angle after the plating beneath it broke away from the barge's main deck.   Total damage to the AGS 967 was estimated at $600.\n \nThe AGS 943 suffered major structural damage to the port side shell, main deck and bottom plating around amidships.  Overall the barge suffered $76,000 in damages and another $7,000 in lost\/damaged cargo.\n\nLock & Dam 1 ACOE personnel reported that the river flow rate at the time of the incident was 24,305 CFS.  They also stated that the above flow rate is double the average June flow rate and was four times higher than the flow rate on 21 June 2002 (one week prior to the incident).  The sudden increase in flow was cause by heavy rains that swept through central MN on June 22nd (3.1\") and 25th (1.6\").  ACOE personnel estimated that the corresponding Mississippi River current in the vicinity of St. Paul would have been 5 to 6 knots.\n\nLock & Dam 2 ACOE personnel reported that only two tows locked through on 28 June 2002 and supplied the actual lockage records for the towboats.  The records indicate that the UTV KATHY ELLEN completed n-bound lockage at 0630 (local time) with a string of 11-barges and that the UTV NEIL N. DIEHL completed n-bound lockage at 1130 (local time) with a string of 12-barges. \n\nA review of the Mississippi River charts indicates that the distance from L&D 2 to the Dakota Barge Fleet is about 20.7 NM.\n\nOpinions:\n\nAfter considering interviews with URS personnel, reviewing ACOE lock records and projecting a northerly towboat speed made good of approximately 3-knots, it is probable that the UTV KATHY ELLEN was transiting  near the Dakota Barge Fleeting area when the incident occurred.  It is also likely that the KATHY ELLEN was generating a wake as it attempted to overcome a strong current with a large string of barges.  It is also possible that fleeting tugs and recreational vessels may have been in the area at the time of the incident.\n\nURS mooring lines and methods in place at the time of the incident are considered adequate for the prevailing conditions.  URS has historically had numerous barge strings in place at several mooring locations throughout the navigation season.  This has been accomplished without any notable record of breakaways.  In this case, their standard mooring practices were adhered to.  However, the fact the barges were fleeted together put a lot of strain on the mooring lines and barge deck fittings since they were holding the entire string of barges as a composite unit.  \n\nURS emergency response to the incident was very timely\/effective and greatly minimized the overall disruption to vessel traffic and the potential for further damage.\n\nThe deck fitting on the AGS 967 should not have failed under the prevailing conditions.  The plating, securing the fitting to the main deck, was weakened in some manner prior to the incident.\n\nOverall, the incident is considered an accident with no noteworthy negligence on behalf of the involved parties.  Thus, no civil penalty or suspension\/revocation actions were initiated.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe weakened deck fitting on the AGS 967 is a considered to be a major contributing factor to the incident in that it failed and allowed the barge string's stern mooring line to slip off.\n\nThe strong river current is considered a contributing factor in that it applied considerable force to the composite barge string and mooring lines.  The strong current also made it more difficult for northerly tows to transit without generating a wake.\n\nA vessel wake (most likely from the UTV KATHY ELLEN) is considered to be a contributing factor in that it was the probable source of a dynamic shock force that broke the barge string away from its mooring.\n\n\n"}

The HAGAR suffered significant damage throughout the derrick, its foundation and the barge's two spuds.  In recognition of the damage to the derrick and barge, the HAGAR was maneuvered out of the channel for post-casualty inspection and temporary bracing prior to being moved to Richmond, California for permanent repairs.  \n\nThe primary causal factor in this marine casualty was the mistaken belief by the Master of the towboat, the M\/V BEARCAT, that the derrick would \"clear\" all bridges.   Statements taken from the tow operator, the deckhand (Deck-Engineer) and representatives from the HAGAR, indicated that the barge crew did tell the tow operator that the derrick would clear all bridges.  Unfortunately, it was never explicitly stated that in order to clear the UPRR Bridge, the lift section of that bridge would need to be in the raised position.  The air-draft of the HAGAR was calculated as 117 feet above the water and the clearance of the UPRR Bridge with the lift section in the down position was less than 70 feet.\n\nThere was no pollution or personal injuries as a result of this incident.  No Enforcement Action (EA) was taken against the crew of the BEARCAT.\n\n"}

The NCC MEKKA was being towed at the stern by the towing vessel FORT BRAGG, O.N.  1074922.\n\nThe Cape Fear River above the Hilton Railroad Bridge has no turning basin, the only method for ships departing the Chemserve Facility is to be towed backwards by the stern until they are well clear of the Hilton Railroad Bridge before they can turn around.\n\nThe towboat FORT BRAGG was passing through the Hilton Railroad Bridge, towing the NCC MEKKA by the stern, the NCC MEKKA was using the bow thruster to keep her bow in line, when the pilot onboard the NCC MEKKA determined the bow thruster was not working.\n\nThe NCC MEKKA master and the pilot immediately ordered forward turns to keep from passing under the bridge, when the ship began to power back up river, she towed the towing vessel, FORT BRAGG. The FORT BRAGG now under tow, struck the north side fendering system as she was towed backwards causing damage to the wooden structure of the bridge pier fendering system.  The bridge piers and structure where not affected according to follow-up inspections performed by CSX railroad bridge engineers.\n\nThe cause of this casualty was the failure of the NCC MEKKA's bow thruster.\n\nThe allision was reported immediately and an on scene investigation followed.

Damage was sustained to both the structure of the bridge, operational control of the bridge, and its fendering.  The barge also sustained minor damage due to the impact.  \n\nThe vessel also reported that just prior to the allision that the STBD towing cable had parted.  The vessel was able to regained control of the barge following the allision at which time they continued up river to their final destination in Haverstraw, NY.  \n\nAt approximately 0730, the vessel was attempting to approached the pier and tie up.  As the vessel made for the dredged channel into the pier the vessel ran aground while towing the empty barge.

{"activity_id":1747786,"brief":"On 21 February 2003 at approximately 0036, the M\/V ELLY LANE was heading southbound on the Lower Mississippi River at MM 530.8 with 10 barges in tow (9 empty, 1 loaded).  While transiting the Greenville Bridge, the port stern barge, CBC 226 (empty red flag) struck the left descending pier of the channel span causing extensive damage to the #2 Port Wing Void.  The tow remained together during the incident, but the starboard face wire broke.  Following the allision, the tow was landed on the right descending bank, south of the new bridge construction site where the broken face wire was replaced and the barges were surveyed by Mr. XXX XXXXXXXX.\n\nThe pilot on board the M\/V ELLY LANE at the time of the incident was Mr. XXXXXX X. XXXXXXXX (CG Lic. # XXXXXX).\n\nThe vessel was boarded by the MSD Greenville Marine Investigator (LT) the Drug Testing Representative, and Mr. XXX XXXXX (Canal Barge Port Engineer) at 0910 on 21 February 2003.  \n\nAn interview of Mr. XXXXXXXX was conducted at 0930 by LT XXXXXXXX.  Mr. XXXXXXXX had been on watch for one hour prior to the incident.  A fatigue analysis using the Fatigue Investigation Worksheet was conducted on Mr. XXXXXXXX revealing no fatigue related issues.  During his approach to the Greenville Bridge, Mr. XXXXXXXX set the M\/V ELLY LANE and its' tow on the range lights located on the center span of the Greenville Bridge.  As Mr. XXXXXXXX piloted the vessel and its' tow under the Greenville Bridge, the current pushed the tow onto the left descending pier (drafted tow sideways) damaging the CBC 226 on its' port side.  Following the allision, the tow \"bounced\" back into the channel permitting the M\/V ELLY LANE and the remaining length of the tow to pass safely under the Greenville Bridge without further damage.\n\nCause of Incident:  Mr. XXXXXXXX was not expecting the tow to draft as much as it did while passing under the Greenville Bridge.  Due to a recent rise in the Lower Mississippi River, current conditions changed significantly within a week prior to the incident.  Mr. XXXXXXXX stated that if he had know that the draft in way of the Greenville Bridge was going to be as much as it was, he would have set the vessel and its' tow up more toward the Right Descending Bank during the bridge approach.\n\nThe weather condition at the time of the incident was rainy with a slight haze.  According to Mr. XXXXXXXX, the channel buoys, bridge piers, and bridge range lights could be seen despite the rain and haze.  Mr. XXXXXXXX stated that the weather was not a factor in this incident.\n\n\"International Drug Detection\" conducted an alcohol breath test and obtained urine samples at approximately 1000 on 21 February, 2003.  All drug test results were XXXXXXXX for alcohol and drugs.  Alcohol\/Drugs were not a factory in this incident.\n\nConclusion:  The pilot, Mr. XXXXXXXX, of the M\/V ELLY LANE misjudged the current in way of the Greenville Bridge.  The incident occurred at night, making it very difficult for current conditions to be observed.  Mr. XXXXXXXX stated that he has been a towing vessel master for twenty years.  His experience with river navigation, river stages, and familiarity of the area should have provided him with the knowledge to make safe approach and transit of the Greenville Bridge.  Mr. XXXXXXXX received an LOW previously for alliding with the Hwy 41 bridge on the Ohio River on 28 July, 1998 causing several barges to be damaged.  \n\nIt is recommended that Mr. XXXXXXXX be given a Letter of Warning for negligent operation of a vessel.\n\nNo further action to be taken.\n\nIssued Permit To Proceed for the CBC 226.  Vessel is to proceed to Baton Rouge to effect repairs.  COTP Baton Rouge notified of vessel's condition.

{"activity_id":1877277,"brief":"INTRODUCTION:\n\nOn 15 Aug 03 @ approx 0855, T\/B CHEM 303 (O.N. 511892), being pushed by the uninspected towing vessel (UTV) TED W. EWING (O.N. 637374) outbound on the Houston Ship Channel (HSC) along w\/ 3 other barges, swung free from the tow & allided with the Fred Hartman (Highway 146) bridge.  UTV TED W. EWING subsequently backed over & destroyed flashing green light #103 (LLNR 23995) in the aftermath of the allision.  Encl (2), (3), (4), (8) & (12).\n\nFACTS:\n\nCaptain of UTV TED W. EWING, picked up the 4 barges in the tow @ Carpenter's Bayou (off HSC) on 14 Aug 03.  The barges, all loaded w\/ an even 9' draft, were to be pushed from Carpenter's Bayou to Baton Rouge, LA.  The CHEM 303, which is 2600 gross tons, 195' x 52', was loaded w\/ styrene.\n\nThe tow configuration was 1x2x1, w\/ the CHEM 303 being the single lead barge of the tow.  Her stern was made up centered to the bows of the barges ACL 00604 (O.N. 1093406) & ACL 02137 (O.N. 1139659).  The sterns of the barges ACL 00604 & ACL 02137 were made up centered to the bow of the T\/B CHEM 3701 (O.N. 511892), whose stern was made up centered to the bow of the UTV TED W. EWING.  Encl (6), (7) & (8).\n\nThe UTV TED W. EWING is a 60' long, 1200 hp, twin screw towboat.  The total length of the tow, as configured by Captain , was 892'.  The width of the tow, at her widest point, was 70'.  Encl ( 5) & (7).\n\nThe CHEM 303 swung free from the tow when the outermost wire coupling (3\/4\" inch, double knit) connecting her port stern to the ACL 00604 snapped after the UTV TED W. EWING executed a starboard turn to make way for an approaching inbound deep draft vessel that she was meeting on one whistle (i.e. port to port) at the Fred Hartman bridge.  After the outermost coupling on the port stern of the CHEM 303 broke, the other two wire couplings on her port stern also snapped, followed by her center stern rope safety line (2.75\", double twine).  None of the three wire couplings connecting her starboard stern to the ACL 02137 broke or even severed.\n\nWhen the CHEM 303 swung free, she pivoted starboard towards the Fred Hartman bridge, pulling the entire tow w\/ her.  Captain  tried to go hard astern on both screws, but the CHEM 303 struck the concrete footing on the west side of the bridge, chipping a concrete block & holing the barge near her starboard bow rake in way of a void, below the waterline.  The barge took on water, but no cargo was discharged.  The barge was subsequently dewatered w\/ two portable pumps & towed by another UTV to Channel Shipyard for repairs.  See inspection activity # 1877597.  Encl (8).\n\nPilot of UTV TED W. EWING, took the wheel after the allision while Captain went out to secure the CHEM 303.  In the process of securing the barge, crewmember inadvertently backed over light # 103 just west of the bridge.  After the barge was secured, crewmember pushed the tow onto the west side bank of the HSC just below the Fred Hartman bridge near light # 101, and he notified VTS Houston-Galveston of the incident @ approx 0855.\n\nMSO Houston-Galveston notified D8(ob) & the bridge owner as soon as the allision was reported to us by VTS.  VTS notified USCG Group Galveston of the ATON discrepancy after UTV TED W. EWING backed over light #103.  See message P 151818Z AUG 03.  Encl (12).\n\nEVIDENCE:\n\nWhen interviewed, Captain admitted that his chosen 1x2x1 tow configuration placed excessive stress on the couplings connecting the lead barge, causing the wires to snap.  Pilot Short confirmed this, as did the 2 deckhands that we interviewed.\n\nCaptain relayed that he made a one whistle meeting arrangement w\/ an approaching inbound deep draft ship well before the Fred Hartman bridge, but when he started his starboard swing to \"make room\" for the ship, the CHEM 303 broke free from her port couplings.  Captain said that he was approx 1\/4 mile away from the approaching ship when this happened.  He feels that the ship \"had nothing to do\" with the barge breaking free from her couplings.  Captain did not remember the name of the ship or the identification number of the Houston pilot onboard the ship (whom he previously spoke with on VHF FM channel 13).\n\nCaptain stated that both he & the approaching deep draft ship were riding \"center channel\" before meeting.  That is why Captain had to turn starboard to \"make room\" for the ship, i.e. he had to get over to the right.  \n\nSince the charted depth of the entire HSC proper is 40', it is unclear why Captain was riding \"center channel\" w\/ only a 9' draft.  Furthermore, since the charted width of the HSC proper is 400', it is unclear why Captain  was riding \"center channel\" w\/ only a 70' wide tow.  For the sake of safety, he should have been further over on the green side \/ outbound lane of the HSC instead of riding \"center channel\" close to, or encroaching in, the red side \/ inbound lane of the HSC.  Encl (4).\n\nAll 4 witnesses that we interviewed, including Captain, corroborated that the 3\/4\" double knit wires used to make up the tow were in excellent condition, as were the wenches & chocks\/bitts.  Our visual inspection confirmed the excellent condition of the towing gear, ruling out the possibility that equipment and\/or material failure caused and\/or contributed to this casualty.\n\nCaptain advised that a 2x2 box configuration would have been much more stable & safe, but he claimed that it would be \"too slow\" to go all the way to Baton Rouge w\/ such a tow configuration.  Captain said that he would have actually preferred to string all the barges out, 1x1x1x1, but that such a configuration was too long for the fleeting area at Carpenter's Bayou.\n\nThere is no evidence that drugs, alcohol and\/or fatigue played any role in this casualty.\n\nConclusion:\n\nCaptain knowingly chose an unsafe tow configuration.  He should have either used a 2x2 box, made arrangements w\/ a different, larger fleeting area to string out the barges 1x1x1x1, or not have taken one or more of the barges to Baton Rouge.  His 1x2x1 configuration placed excessive stress on the lead barge couplings, especially when turning the tow.\n\nFurthermore, given the tow's relatively shallow draft & limited width, he should not have been pushing the tow \"center channel\" in the HSC.  He should have been well on his side of the channel, eliminating the need to swing sharply to starboard to \"make room\" for approaching deep draft vessel traffic.\n\nSee MISLE enforcement activity # 1887508 for enforcement action against Captain's license for his role in casualty.\n\nCase closed.\n"}

A second attempt was made, again the engine did not start.  The chief engineer (CE) tried to start the MDE a third time from the local control (emergency mode, all electrical signals by-passed), and again the engine failed to start.  Two tugs were tethered to the vessel, one forward and one aft, the vessel was safely moored at GCT berth #3 at about 0136 hrs.  While mooring the MDE successfully responded to a dead slow astern command.  The master stated the vessel never lost astern propulsion.\n\nThe MDE is a 9-cylinder slow-speed Sulzer, the CE could not immediately identify any problems and the only alarm noted was the 10 second start time limit alarm.  If the engine fails to start after 10 seconds an alarm sounds in the control room.  \n\n1200 hrs:  In company with Germanischer Lloyd (GL) class surveyor,  to conduct an incident investigation.  Met with the Master,, and the CE, to review the casualty and the corrective steps taken thus far.  The CE believes the problem was with the control air system, possibly contamination or debris in the system.  He had already inspected the starting air block valve, the control valve for the block valve and all control air and starting air connections for leaks noting no problems.  Since re-assembling the system, the MDE was started numerous times in both directions without any problems.  \n\nDiscussed the propulsion system and potential causes of the failure with the CE.  Also reviewed control air and starting air system drawing #RTA84C (enclosed in case file).  Concurred with the CE and the class surveyor that the failure was likely caused by a problem with the control air system.  The vessel never lost \"astern\" propulsion suggesting the problem was with the \"ahead\" signal.  Possibly control air valve #49HA (piston type valve) had stuck due to system contamination\/debris.  Had this valve opened as designed an \"ahead\" signal would have been sent to the starting air distributor, thereby starting the \"ahead\" start sequence.  \n\nInspected control air filter noting good conditions.  Although valve #49HA was not opened and inspected, its operability was tested as the air lines to the distributor were disconnected to verify adequate air signals were sent.  Additionally, witnessed 8 start stops of the MDE from the bridge and control room.

{"activity_id":1886997,"brief":"On 19 August 2003, the M\/V SUPERAMERICA was southbound at Ohio River mile 606.5 with 3 loaded barges, 2 of which were carrying gasoline, the third diesel.  The AI 531, with it's load of gasoline, was the starboard barge at the head of the tow.  At approximately 1100, the tow passed beneath the Clark Highway Bridge in downtown Louisville.  Construction activities could be seen taking place on the surface of the bridge, and while the vessel was passing under the bridge, one of the crew indicated he saw sparks falling.  At 1140, while in the Louisville and Portland Canal immediately above McAlpine Lock and Dam, the deck crew observed a small flame in the vicinity of the starboard number 1 cargo tank manhole.  The tow was immediately stopped and secured to the adjacent lock long wall, above the lock but now blocking entering and departing lock traffic.  The M\/V SUPERAMERICA separated from the tow, maneuvered adjacent to the site of the fire, and extinguished the flame by 1150 using the vessel's fire main and foam system.  Not knowing the extent of the fire, and as a precaution against reflash, a water curtain was sprayed on the AI 531 by the vessel as well the USCGC OBION, which happened to be in the vicinity.  The M\/V GAIL ANN was also on scene assisting in the response.  The water curtain was continued for approximately 3 hours, when Coast Guard and fire department officials determined in was safe to stop.  A preliminary assessment of the barge showed no damage, and there were no spills or injuries.  The M\/V SUPERAMERICA locked through, and later that afternoon MAP and Coast Guard officials performed a closer inspection of the barge.

The Master of the tug had been on watch for 5 hours at the time of the incident.  Barge KS-4509 is a deck barge with a track crane strapped down to the deck of the barge.  The vessel and barge worked block 37 in Venice and were transiting back to Houma, LA.  The crane was boomed down on the 25th of August at 0100.  Chet Morrison Contracting Co. personnel, owner\/operators of the crane barge, were on board to boom down the crane.  The crew of DESIREE noted that the crane operators were in a hurry to finish the job.  The attached digital photographs clearly show that the boom of the crane was sitting very high at the time of the allision and clearly the crane could have been boomed down much further on the 25th of August.  Neither the crew of the DESIREE, nor Chet Morrison personnel, knew the exact clearance of the crane barge.  Regardless, Tug DESIREE departed Venice with the crane barge.  During the transit on the night of the 25th and morning of the 26th the tug and crane barge successfully passed under the Algiers Bridge and Bell Chase bridge.  The Master,  Pitre,  closely watched the boom pass under both bridges and since he had made it under those bridges, he only assumed  the crane would pass under the Crowne Point Bridge.  Pitre did not consult the chart to confirm that the clearance for the Crowne Point Bridge is 20 feet less than the other bridges.  His negligence to confirm the clearance of the bridge and the clearance of the crane led to the allision.  At 0220 the boom of the crane hit the Crowne Point bridge.  When the crane hit, the boom rode upward on the side of the bridge face.  Then, the top of the crane crashed through the iron work and cement deck of the bridge, causing an approximate 1.5 sq ft hole on the tarmac.  The center span light on the bridge was also broken.  Damage to the barge included a split wire where a cable secured the boom and headache ball to the port\/fwd corner of the barge.  Upon impact the base of the crane was shoved back 11 feet, splitting the port wire cable that previously secured the crane to the deck.  No further damages, pollution or injuries to report.

{"activity_id":1929758,"brief":"At 2030 on 31 Jul 03 the M\/V DRU LIRETTE was pushing a tow of 15 dry cargo barges.  While entering the Portland Canal at OHR mile 604.5 on of the barges in the tow made contact with a protection cell for the L & I Railroad bridge.  The Operator stated that he was not sure if it actually made contact or not and there was no damage to the barge in question.  The Operator later informed the CG that the barge (TA 118) immediately forward of the barge that was suspected of hitting the cell, was taking on water.  When MSO personnel arrived on scene they observed a slight rub mark on the side shell of the barge MEM 5064, that was thought to have hit the cell.  Investigators then moved to the TA 118 and observed that all of the wing voids were flooding.  Investigators observed what appeared to be preexisting shingles in one of the void that were dislodged.  The crew had five dewatering pumps running and the barge was still taking on water.  Eventually two additional pumps were added and the crew starting gaining on the flooding.  The following day the crew was able to pump off enough water for a Marine Surveyor to inspect the damage and temporary repairs were made, the Surveyor stated the barge was repaired well enough to proceed to its destination and then to a repair facility.  The repair estimate was $5000.  The investigators interviewed the operator and the deckhand that witnessed the allision.  Both accounts of the incident led the Investigator to believe that the barge MEM 5064 was the one that made contact with the cell.  The physical evidence of the rub marks on the side shell supported that conclusion.  The operator stated that his tow was set toward the cell by the draw from the cut out in the Vane Dyke.  He tried to avoid making contact with the cell and was not sure that he made contact or not until he observed the marks on the barge.  The deck hand stated that he was on a barge forward of the one that made contact and was watching as the tow passed.  He stated that he observed the background light between the cell and the barges as they passed.  He stated the light disappeared for a brief moment as the MEM 5064 was passing the cell and then came back.  When the surveyor was able to enter the stbd #1 wing tank on the TA 118,  he observed an area between the 2nd and 3rd lower longitudinal that was set in 0 - 3\" and ran the entire length of the barge, the surveyor noted the damage appeared to be new.  The surveyor also observed a 14\" x 2\" at the #2 aft bulkhead, this hole was shingled.  Based on the surveyor's observations it is believed the TA 118 made contact with something below the surface that was part of or near the protection cell.  I. O. recommends that a OCMI Letter of Warning be issued to the Operator of the M\/V DRU LIRETTE."}

{"activity_id":1981248,"brief":"10 January 2004 - The UTV ELIZABETH was underway east bound on the Eastern Branch of the \nElizabeth River, pushing the BARGE WEEKS 320 on the port hip, bound for Lyon's Shipyard.\n\n1715L - The mate was at the controls of the tug and the master was positioned on the port bow of the barge for the transit through the bridges on the Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River.  XXXXX moved the ELIZABETH to the extreme southern side of the channel for the approach to Railroad Bridge 5.  [Railroad Bridge 5 is a bascule bridge.  When it is fully opened the lift span extends over the waterway at an angle.  The vertical clearance varies under the lift span depending on how far to the north a vessel passes under the lift span.]  \n\nBecause of the size\/shape of the tug and barge, the visibility concerns and the bend in the river, XXXXX was concerned about allowing the vessels to get too far to the north.  XXXXX slowed to clutch speed only, approximately one knot, trying to keep the approach at a controllable speed but sacrificing maneuverability.  During the approach to the bridge, XXXXX did not have enough speed to adequately control the tug and barge.  As a result, he let the ELIZABETH get too far to the south and allided with the moored barge BILLY D at a very slow speed.\n\n1720L - The starboard quarter of the ELIZABETH was the only portion of the vessel to allide with the BILLY D.  XXXXX and XXXXX used the spotlight to look for any damage to the BILLY D.  Since the allision occurred at less than one knot there was no damage to either vessel.  \n\nXXXXX reoriented the ELIZABETH and barge WEEKS 320 toward Railroad Bridge 5 and realized the vessels were in good position for the approach to the bridge.  XXXXX was primarily concerned with the width of the tug and tow with the additional five foot pipe that protrudes from the port side of the barge.  XXXXX was also concerned with the air draft of the spuds on the WEEKS 320.  XXXXX decided the safest course of action to pass through the bridge would be to stay as far to the south as possible and to proceed at clutch speed.  Because the ELIZABETH had the WEEKS 320 made up on the hip, XXXXX knew that he was giving up  maneuverability in order to keep the speed slow.  \n\n1725L - While transiting under Railroad Bridge 5 Basinski realized that the tug and barge were drifting to starboard towards the bridge.  XXXXX decided that his choices were to increase revolutions on the starboard propeller or to allow the vessel to lay against the bridge's fenders and use the fender to pivot back towards the center of the channel.  XXXXX decided that while increasing power to the starboard propeller would possibly avoid an allision, the damage created by any resulting allision would be greater than allowing the vessel to lay against the fender system at less than one knot.  XXXXX decided to disengage the engine and make a slow landing against the bridge fender.  \n\n1728L - The starboard quarter of the ELIZABETH allided with the fender system of Railroad Bridge 5 at less than one knot.  XXXXX pivoted the vessel off the fendering system, reorienting the direction of the tug and tow toward the center of the channel and proceeded through the opening.  \n\n1745L - XXXXX moored at Lyon's shipyard without further incident and contacted HMRMS to report the allisions.\n\n2030L - HMRMS Investigating Officer arrived with HMRMS Inspectors XXXXX and XXXXX.  Alcohol tests were administered to XXXXX and XXXXX with negative results.  \n\n2100L - XXXXX got the ELIZABETH underway with XXXXX to conduct a navigation safety check and examine the bridge and barge BILLY D.  No steering, navigation or propulsion problems were noted on the ELIZABETH.  All charts were corrected with recent Notice to Mariners retained on board.  XXXXX inspected the BILLY D and the ELIZABETH and noted that there was no visible damage.  No damage was noted on the fendering system of Railroad Bridge 5.\n\nThis was XXXXX first attempt to transit through Railroad Bridge 5 on the ELIZABETH in this configuration.  He had witnessed it once before during his break-in process.  He calculated the clearances in advance and planned the trip to coincide with slack current.  XXXXX had a reasonable plan to safely transit through the bridge but sacrificed too much maneuverability by going at clutch speed, and was unable to maintain control of the tug and barge.  Although XXXXX failed to provide a credible no fault explanation to overcome the presumption of negligence that arises whenever a vessel allides with a fixed object, this incident was deemed not actionable.  The mitigating factors such as the safety conscious approach, amount of damage and XXXXX actions once the vessel was in extremis outweigh the presumption of negligence.  This case was not referred for enforcement."}

The river stage was 44.7.  Immediately after the Captain,  came on watch, the boat's forward momentum stalled as they passed Sliding Hill Bend due to the river's excessive flow and currents.  The M\/V River Hawk and her tow was forced into the bank on the Ohio side of the river.  The middle of the tow struck the river bank across from the Sliding Hill Bend Light, resulting in the nine lead barges breaking loose from the tow.  The boat and remaining barges struck the Pomeroy-Mason Highway Bridge pier.  Specifically, the crew indicated that barge \"CBY 265\" contacted the bridge.  \n\nThe Pomeroy-Mason bridge was immediately closed to traffic by local authorities and inspected by the Ohio Department of Transportation.  The bridge was later reopened after the inspection revealed no significant structural damage. The M\\V A.A. Vestal, M\/V Robert P. Tibolt, M\/V William Robinson, M\/V Fred R. Shedd, M\/V Gale R. Rhodes, and M\/V Lacey Nicole all came to the scene to assist with rounding up barges.  All barges were collected at approximately 0830.   There were numerous reports of property damage made to the Coast Guard COTP Huntington (from both commercial and private sources) that were passed to Excell Marine for settlement.  \n\nDrug testing was ordered by the marine employer and conducted on 08 Jan 04.  One unlicensed crewmember  employment was terminated by Excell Marine.\n\nThere were no injuries, deaths, or reports of pollution. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\nAll statements and correspondence received by the involved parties indicate that there were no engineering casualties that lead to the M\/V RIVER HAWK loosing momentum.  Therefore, the cause of the grounding and subsequent barge break-away and allision with the Pomeroy-Mason Highway bridge was a result of the insufficient horsepower of the M\/V RIVER HAWK given the river condition on 7 Jan 04.  \n\nA letter of warning against Excel Marine has been submitted.  In a phone conversation between LTJG and representative for Excell Marine Corporation on 12 Feb 04, it was indicated that Excell would not dispute a letter of warning and they will reevaluate their current policy of 250 h.p. per barge.\n\nCWO3, INVESTIGATING OFFICER\n\nLTJG, INVESTIGATING OFFICER\n\n09 MAR 04:  Excell representative advised LTJG  during a phone conversation, that Excell Marine increased their horsepower per barge policy to 400 shaft horsepower (from 250).  Justification for this change was that using the advertised shaft horsepower of a vessel was dangerous since the calculations are done when the vessel is new and not after the horsepower naturally degrades from normal mechanical wear.  The representative also mentioned that Excell's vessel captains were advised to immediately call the safety director if they feel that any operation is unsafe.   \n\nLTJG, INVESTIGATING OFFICER"}

{"activity_id":2003945,"brief":"32\/20\/04 MMS\n\nIncident Description:\n\nThe Parker Drilling Rig 56-B was engaged in a tow with the M\/V Celia Ann and the M\/V Miss Stacie.  The M\/V Miss Stacie was the lead tug in the tow.  In preparation for a transit through the Bayou Bouef Railroad Bridge (SPRR Bridge)(29-40.1N,   090-06.0W). Deckhand #1 was posted on the bow of the Parker Rig to check clearance on either side of the rig.  Deckhand #1 was equipped with a handheld radio.  Because the M\/V Celia Ann could not see around the rig to judge clearance, Deckhand #1's job was to direct the vessel on steering to safely navigate between the bridge trusses.  \n\nJust prior to transiting through the bridge, Deckhand #1 checked clearance on the starboard side and radioed the Captain of the M\/V Celia Ann, Crewmember #2, to come slightly to starboard. At this time, it is estimated that the tug and tow were traveling at about 2.5 knots.  Crewmember #2, the master, then came slightly to starboard.  While walking to the port side of the rig to check clearance, Deckhand #1 stepped on a manhole cover.  The manhole cover was dysfunctional in that the strong back was missing.  Deckhand #1 fell partially into the manhole, and had to be assisted by two rig deckhands to get out.  After being helped out of the manhole Mr. Lirette noticed the rig was not going to have enough clearance.  He radioed the M\/V Celia Ann to stop.  Crewmember #2 of the Celia Ann put his engines in full reverse in order prevent an allision, but this was not successful.  The rig allided with the Railroad Bridge at its starboard bow, causing damage to the freeboard around the starboard bow cleat.  The allision also caused damage to the bridge itself by bending a truss.\n\nConsequences of Damage to Railroad Bridge:\n\nAs a result of the bridge allision, the SPRR Bridge was closed for a period of four days in which no railway traffic was permitted to travel over it.  Subsequently, for the next week, separate inspections and closures caused delays in rail traffic.  The bridge has been repaired and is fully operational.\n\nEnforcement\/Recommendations:\n\nAn interview conducted with the captain of the M\/V Miss Stacie showed that the captain had frequently transited through the bridge with no incident.  The captain has held a license for over 35 years. The Captain stated two factors contributed to the allision.  The first is the small clearance allowable for a vessel and tow to pass through.  The barge was 54' wide and the bridge opening was 56'. The second factor is the loss of help from the deckhand who was momentarily disrupted from his duties by falling into the manhole cover.  The Parker company has been notified of this safety hazard and the need to be more vigilant of hazards of the decks of their barges.  Although this the deckhand's fall did not directly cause the bridge allision, it can certainly be considered an contributing factor.  No enforcement action is recommended for any of the involved parties."}

As he neared the Charenton Canal (Baldwin) RR Bridge at 0750, Captain # 1 stated that he called the bridge tender, Person # 1, on the telephone to open the bridge.  As Captain # 1  rounded the bend, he said the bridge wasn't open and he started to slow down.  He stated that he again called the bridge tender via radio and telephone at 0800, to which the bridge tender replied that a shift change had just occurred and that he wasn't told the UTV ROSE D. was approaching.  The bridge tender then began opening the bridge, and Captain # 1 said that the current was pushing the barges at a 45 degree angle as he went through the opened bridge.

The operator onboard the tug PHIL MOSESSO immediately sounded the general alarm to alert the crew.  The operator attempted to bring the port steering pump motor online but it too failed and would not operate properly.  The bearing in the starboard steering pump motor seized causing the motor coil and breaker box to overload.  As a result of the motor coil and breaker overloading, excessive heat was generated in the motor coils and the starboard steering pump motor caught on fire.  The fire was immediately extinguished by the vessel's crewmembers using portable fir extinguishers.  The fire was confined to the starboard steering pump motor.  The port steering pump failed to come online as a result of a seized bearing.\n\nAs a result of the starboard steering pump motor shutting down and the port not coming online, the vessel lost partial maneuverability and began drifting towards the CSX Transportation Railroad Bridge.  The operator made attempts to control the vessel using propulsion alone in order to minimize any potential damage in the event of an allision.

Captain lined the ELIS up to transit the center of the bridge span.  He expected the wind at the barge's stern and to have approximately 25 feet of horizontal clearance on each side of the barge.\n\n0845L - After the ELIS and most of the SMURFIT STONE 25 had safely cleared the bridge span a gust of cross wind, approximately 35 - 40 knots on the starboard quarter, pushed the port side of the barge into the fendering system of the Eltham Bridge.  \n\n0900L - After clearing the bridge, Captain slowed the ELIS in the middle of the channel and sent the tug's engineer to see if there was any apparent damage to the barge or bridge.  The engineer reported that he could not see any evidence of damage to the barge.  The bridge tender contacted the ELIS via VHF radio and reported that he had checked the bridge and there was some damage to the pilings making up the end of the fendering system.  The bridge tender also reported that his wind gauges verified that a strong cross wind gust had caught the barge.\n\n1110L - Captain contacted HMRMS to report the allision.  Captain stated that he didn't believe there was any damage to the barge and that he intended to continue to Elizabeth City.  He stated that there were no mechanical problems with the ELIS and that all steering, navigation and propulsion systems were working perfectly.  HMRMS authorized Traywick to continue the transit to Elizabeth City.\n\nDISCUSSION:\n\nWhen questioned by HMRMS investigators, the Captain stated that he felt the stern tow was safe considering the weather and the direction of the wind.  Since the wind was on the stern and he wasn't experiencing crosswind, Captain decided that he could transit under the bridge on a short hawser and then pay out line for the transit down the Chesapeake Bay.  This would allow the hawser to act as a shock absorber in the heavy weather.  This decision is generally in keeping with standard marine practice.  Captain stated that had he anticipated the cross winds or if he had it to do again, he would put the barge in pushing gear.  \n\nNOAA issued a wind advisory and Gale Warning for that section of the Chesapeake Bay and the Captain was aware of the weather broadcast.  The existence of crosswinds and high wind gusts are something a prudent mariner should anticipate.  Although the Captain failed to provide a credible no fault explanation to overcome the presumption of negligence that arises whenever a vessel allides with a fixed object, this incident was not referred for enforcement.  The minimal damage that occurred in this allision, coupled with the Captain's safety record, action to report the casualty and efforts to learn from the event to improve the company's future operations were considered in this decision.\n"}

He will send his people out this am to inspect.  1230\/ Rcvd report from Lee County DOT that  nothing other than some minor splintering of a bridge fender had occurred.\n\n07APR2004-  Spoke with Captain and requested he submit a CG-2692 within 5 days.  MSD awaiting return of form.  \n\nConclusions\/recommendations:\n\nThe RNA in force for the \"A\" span has been in effect since November 2003.  It was being broadcast initially  by Group St. Petersburg for a duration of 14 days beginning in November.  Speaking with Local Notice to Mariners editor Bernie Dukes the RNA was never published.  \n\nThe bridge tender on duty  was aware of the RNA in place.  He is the \"last line of defense\" for the implementation of the RNA.  When he was asked for a bridge opening especially when the tide was a strong ebb, not slack water, he should have asked the Captain if he was aware of the RNA in place, and if in fact the Captain was not, he should have requested the he, the Captain, contact the CG via VHF 16.\n\nThe bridge tenders internal notification system is flawed seeing as the bridge tender was not aware of the incident until I had contacted him the following day.  \n\nThe above mentioned items have been corrected as a result of this investigation. As per D7 ATON, the RNA will be published in next weeks LNM Had this bridge not have such political and community scrutiny surrounding this it would have been just a \"standard\" allision.   Seeing as the RNA was not being broadcast,  not being published in the Local Notice to Mariners, or posted there would be no way for a transient mariner to be aware of the RNA in place, therefore there is not enough evidence to assess a civil penalty to Captain Masters as the RNA stipulates.  There is also no violation of the twelve hour rule suspected in this Marine Casualty.\n\n"}

Two bridge piers, LDB and RDB, were abandoned by Union Pacific at mile 114.1 on the Ouchita River when the railroad bridge was dismantled.  In the year 1942, a vertical lift railroad bridge (Ouchita Railroad Bridge, operated by Union Pacific RR) was built up bound at mile 114.2, to replace the dismantled bridge.  The UTV FREEDOM operator was steering the UTV's tow around Horseshoe Bend at mile 113.8 when he set a course to transit the channel span of the Ouchita Railroad bridge.  According to the master, he placed the UTV's spot lights to mark the position of the abandoned Union Pacific bridge pier (RDB) upon setting his course of transit.  However, he, set the head of the tow too close to the approaching Union Pacific bridge pier (RDB) and allided the tow's port lead barge, ING 1724, with the pier head-on.

The Seaweed had experienced engine failure and its main mast had been damage at sea (or, according to the owner, it was a prior condition before the voyage).  \n\nAccording to Capt,  as the Daze Off with Seaweed in tow approached the Longboat Pass drawbridge at approximately the seas were running 3' to 4' and the wind was clocked at 8 to 12 MPH from the South West.  Incoming current at the bridge was approximately 3 MPH.  The Daze Off was able to make only 2.3 MPH due to problems with the tow.\n\nSeveral radio contacts were made to the bridge tender, one 45 minutes prior to arrival at the bridge, to advise the tender that due to difficulty in towing and the incoming current the Daze Off would not be able to heave too if the bridge was not open at the time of arrival.  Twelve minutes prior to arrival, the bridge tender acknowledged further contact and as the vessels approached the tender began to open the draw span at 1800 hours.  The Daze Off turned to the north side of the bridge channel, which gave the greatest clearance below the span, and continued inbound.  For unexplained reasons, the bridge tender stopped the opening of the span too low to clear the mast height of the Seaweed which caused the already damaged mast to strike the westerly beam of the span about 2' from the top, further damaging the mast, and damaging the masthead light and VHF antenna.  The bridge immediately began to open further so that the broken mast would not hit any more of the bridge beams.  No damage was reported to the bridge.  \n\nCausal Analysis:  \n\u00b7\tThe operator of the towing vsl elected to tow the S\/V under a drawbridge, in difficult towing arrangement and with inbound strong current.

{"activity_id":2512044,"brief":"On 29 August 2005 Hurricane Katrina impacted the Port of Mobile AL with heavy winds and substantial storm surge. During the course of the storm's impact, the barge MOBILE HEAVY LIFTER, carrying the MODU CHEMUL, broke away from Bender Shipyard 9 on the Mobile Ship Channel where the CHEMUL was engaged in dry dock repairs. The wind and current pushed the MOBILE HEAVY LIFTER and CHEMUL west and northward, colliding with the M\/V FONARUN NAREE, which was moored at the Alabama State Docks. Next, the MOBILE HEAVY LIFTER and CHEMUL allided with the Alabama State Docks coal terminal loading arm, Dock D2, and Berth E resulting in approximately three million dollars of damage. As the MOBILE HEAVY LIFTER and CHEMUL continued northward, they struck the Plains Energy pier and the BP pier causing substantial damage and destruction to each. The MOBILE HEAVY LIFTER and CHEMUL continued northward in the Mobile Ship Channel and proceeded underneath the Cochran Bridge on the north end of Mobile. As they went underneath the bridge, a boom on one end of the CHEMUL impacted the bridge, and stopped the northward progression of the barge\/MODU combination. The impact with the bridge caused the center portion girders of the bridge to shift four inches northward on their bearings. The girders rebounded back and ended up at rest two inches from their original position.  Additionally, chunks of concrete varying from inches to two feet were broken off from the bridge as a result of this allision. The electrical wiring, which ran along the southern side of the bridge, was damaged from the impact. As the storm surge receded, the current changed to southward, freeing the CHEMUL and MOBILE HEAVY LIFTER from their position underneath the bridge. The barge was intercepted by two tugs that assisted in pushing the barge aground on the east side of the channel until a more positively controlled means of recovery could be arranged.\n\tBender Shipyard submitted the mooring plan for CHEMUL \/ MOBILE HEAVY LIFTER for Hurricane Katrina on 26 AUG 2005 in order to comply with USCG Sector Mobile MSIB 20-05. The plan was given a verbal approval by a USCG representative over the phone prior to the hurricane based on a verbal agreement with the shipyard that the same plan used for Hurricane Dennis would be submitted for Hurricane Katrina. Further investigation revealed the faxed submission of the plan for Hurricane Katrina was flawed in that it was actually the plan for Tropical Storm Arlene, not Hurricane Dennis. Furthermore, the fax transmission of the plan was incomplete, only displaying a portion of the text and diagrams. Following the hurricane, when investigators questioned the shipyard Superintendent on what plan they followed to secure the MOBILE HEAVY LIFTER, a diagram of mooring arrangements for Hurricane Dennis was given to investigators, confirming the verbal arrangement made between Sector Mobile and Bender Shipyard. A major discrepancy between the diagram and actual preparations is that the diagram called for the heavy lifter to be submerged, and additional mooring lines used, which did not occur in advance of Hurricane Katrina.\n"}

{"activity_id":2890750,"brief":"The foreign freight vessel AFIYA was inbound to the State Docks at Chickasaw AL.  As the vessel passed under the Cochran Bridge, it began to make its turn to the north west toward Chickasaw Creek.  At the entrance to Chickasaw creek is the Chickasawbogue Railroad Bridge, a swing bridge, which spans the creek running from NE to SW.  As the vessel entered the creek, the starboard bow bulwark made contact with an upper structural member on the north side of the swing bridge, which due to the swing of the bridge was aligned along the east side of the channel.  This structural member was bent along the side for approximately two feet from the impact.  About the same time, the starboard side of the AFIYA made contact with the east fender system of the bridge, causing them to lean slightly northward.  As the vessel proceeded through the bridge the starboard lower side of the vessel also made contact with the southernmost fender system of the bridge, damaging approximately 10 horizontal feet of the fender system and scraping the paint on the side of the vessel.  The vessel proceeded to the dock where it moored without further incident. The bridge was shut down immediately following the incident, but was opened approximately four hours later following an inspection by bridge personnel.  Marine surveyors have estimated the damage to the bridge to be between $65-80K.\n\nThe Pilot reports he approached the Chickasawbogue Bridge at approximately 5 knots.  As he realized an allision was possible, he put the port engine full astern in an attempt to achieve maximum swing or the bow to port.  The response of the vessel was not as he had expected.  Moments after the allision the vessel had slowed to approximately two knots of headway approximately halfway through the bridge channel.  From there the vessel increased its speed and passed the rest of the way through the bridge.  It is likely that during the maneuvering to make the bridge, not enough water was affecting the rudder in order to properly swing and align the ship.  Additionally, the bridge tender reports observing that an unusually low tide had occurred approximately 3 hours earlier resulting in more dry areas than usual.  It is possible that there was not enough water under the vessel to properly turn the ship as it approached the bridge.  Additionally, the resulting flood tide may have set the vessel more ahead than anticipated in its turn into the creek.\n\nA damage survey was conducted on the AFIYA by Lloyds. They determined that as a result of this incident, the starboard forward gunwale from frame 125 to 130 was set in from the top of the rail to the main deck. Brackets in way of attachment between gunwale and deck were found tripped and buckled.  Bulkheads in bosuns store at frames 125 and 127 found buckled in way of deck connection to a depth of 20cm below deck.  Also, the deck plating of the f'ocsle was slightly set in way of the aforesaid damages.  Lloyd's recommended the vessel be allowed to proceed from berth with a recommendation that permanent repairs be carried out within one month."}

No 3. generator was left to take the full load and subsequently tripped offline.  No 4. generator was started, but not before No 3. generator tripped offline.  There was a brief period (5-10 seconds) that the vessel was without total power.  No 4. generator was started, and No 1 & No 2 generators were restarted.  It took about 8 minutes to regain full power, and for the generators to take the full load. \n\nDuring that 8 minute period, while the vessel was under reduced power and maneuverability, the port bow allided with mobile gantry crane # 10 on the facility.  The collision caused paint minimal damage to the vessel, as well as minimal damage to the pier and crane.  The gantry crane was taken out of service by the facility as a precautionary measure, to be inspected.\n\nThe design of the system provides that all generators are supplied fuel by 1 fuel line.  According to the class survey, the vessel changed over from fuel oil to gas oil  to the generators prior to arrival in LA\/LB.  The lines were gravity fed lines, and Class considered the capacity of the gravity lines not sufficient enough for all the generators that were hooked up to it.  The gravity line was unable to supply the proper amount of gas oil when the load of the generators suddenly changed (i.e. the addition of the bow thruster.) and prevented full capacity operation.

The pilot and two deckhands were stationed on the bow of the barge.  The pilot was issuing commands via VHF radio.  The M\/V RUSSELL T was assisting on the starboard bow of the HELEN II.  As the vessel approached the bridge, the line from the HELEN II to the RUSSELL T parted and the HELEN II turned to port, striking the upper structural member of the Chickasabogue R\/R Bridge.  Following impact, the bridge tender was able to swing the southern half of the bridge back into position to prevent additional impacts.  The vessel straightened out, and made it the rest of the way through the bridge without further incident.\n\nThe RUSSEL T had been positioned on the starboard forward side of the HELEN II, and was being pulled by the HELEN II, while in neutral, by a headline which was connected from the forward starboard cleat on the barge to the head of the towing vessel.  Immediately prior to the allision, the RUSSEL T had come ahead to slacken the tow line, and prepare to bring it in.  The pilot who was on the tug was not aware that the tug had put the engine in gear.  As the RUSSELL T came ahead, the bow of the HELEN II swung to port.  The pilot asked the tug if they were pushing on the barge.  They tug stated they were not, and the pilot immediately ordered the tug to back down on the tow line to stop the swing of the barge.  As the tug attempted to back down, the line parted.  Investigation revealed the line was in poor condition prior to parting.\n\nAs a result of the loss of drag on the forward starboard cleat from dragging the RUSSEL T when the RUSSEL T came ahead, in combination with a steady wind out of the southwest pushing on the nearly empty barge, the head of the barge swung to port impacting the bridge.  The bridge was immediately shut down to train traffic, but remained open to navigation.  Approximately 12 hours later, following inspection, the bridge was reopened to trains at a 5 MPH limit.  Initial damage estimates to the bridge were in excess of $100,000.  A main diagonal structural frame and a vertical structural frame, the fourth upright, were bent as a result of the allision.  The barge suffered only a split rail at the bow, on the immediate port side of the stem.  The barge was able to continue on its voyage without further incident. \n"}

When Pilot came onboard and proceeded to move from berth, the vessel experienced a main engine failure and ultimate loss of propulsion.  During interviews, the Captain stated that he was unable to restart the main engine and had no remote control at the bridge and no remote control in the engine control room.  The vessel crew had installed a jumper wire to bypass a potentially faulty solenoid, which allows remote operation of the engine.  The temporary repair was tested with Class society and Semar representatives were present.  The main engine was never started during the test.  The ships electrician sent an email to the company asking if the jumper wire needed to be permanent, or should it be removed.  After he did not receive a response, he decided to remove the jumper wire by cutting it.\n\nThe vessel tested main engine prior to getting underway at local control with no problems.  Remote locations were never tested.  Once all the lines were off the vessel, control was shifted to the bridge with negative results.  Control was immediately shifted to engine room controls, where the engine nearly immediately went down.  \n\nWhen the main engine failed to properly operate, the Captain told the Pilot that he wanted to simply push back to the pier, to diagnose the problem.  However, the Pilot stated that he thought it would be better to deadship tow the vessel to anchor, since they had already pushed away from the pier and had escort tugs in place.  \n\nClass Society examined the vessel and determined that the cause of the control problem was determined to be two micro switches which are actuated by the remote control level at the local control station on the engine.  The micro switches were found to have bad contacts.  The effect was the inhibit the remote control transfer function.  After removing the switches and reconditioning them, the proper operation of the remote control was restored and tested satisfactorily.  \n\n\n"}

MSU team attended subj vsl and UTVs Colorado and South Carolina to conduct preliminary investigation.  Initial findings indicate while maneuvering through the 92nd St bridge and setting up for the EJ&E RR bridge, vsl encountered difficulty turning to stbd, even with tug assistance.  Vsl and tugs engaged full force to turn to stbd and when vsl began swing it could not be stopped in time to avoid being set to port and its port quarter contacted drawbridge pedestal, causing damage to vsl hull (30' above wl) and pedestal of bridge.  Alc\/Drug testing submitted and statements\/photos obtained.\n\nFurther investigation has determined the following facts:\n\n1) Vsl captain and captains of both towboats believe that either shoaling exists in vicinity and bow was aground preventing swing, or that wx conditions (13 kt winds from north up channel) caused sail effect and current drag on vsl signifcant enough to inhibit vsl maneuverability in tight channel.  Wx conditions at time of turn were not present when vsl departed dock\/began transit.\n\n2) Bridge tender interruption on the radio made it difficult for the tug captains to fully ascertain the steering commands from the captain of the Algowood- their primary duty.\n\n3) Lookout on the Algowood was not fully cognizant of the distance between the bridge and the vessel as apparent by his quick adjustment of distances between each prior to the allision.  This could have been due to darkness and position\/height above water.\n\n4) All involved parties stated \"nothing could have been done different to avoid incident.\"  \n\n5) Distance between bridges is appx 650 ft.  Channel width is 180 ft.  Vsl size involved is 740 ft wide by .

The vessel struck the centerline portion of the bridge.  No damage to the bridge was sustained, the vessel incurred damage at the top 8 feet of the mast, specifically, the mast was bent aft at approximately an 80 degree angle, affecting operation of the VHF radio and the mast white running light.\n\nThe I-610 is charted at 136 feet (NOAA Chart), above the HSC at mean high tide.  USCG Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) requires vessels with an air draft over 129 feet to check in with VTS at the Sea Buoy and make VTS aware of the air draft.  VTS watch supervisor will then contact the Port of Houston Police Department to get the current gauge readings at the bridge.  The VTS watch supervisor will relay this information back to the vessel, who will then adjust the vessels ballast\/draft to ensure it fit underneath the bridge.  In this particular incident, the pilot was relying on the information presented to him from the pilot card.  The pilot card indicated the air draft was under 129 feet, specifically, the air draft for the vessel was 121.74 feet, thus falling under the criteria for notification for transit underneath the I-610 bridge.\n\nAfter the allision with the bridge occurred, there was obliviously a discrepancy at some point.  The vessel conducted a survey of the mast, and it was determined that the air draft as indicated on the pilot card should be approximately 155 feet.  The source of the discrepancy on the original pilot card and vessel drawings is unknown, but it is suspected that some point during the vessel's history, there were add-ons to the mast.  Since the conclusion of the survey, the vessel's drawings, and pilot card has been correct.  All damage sustained by the mast as a result of the allision has been corrected to the satisfaction of the vessel's classification society, and the operation control placed on the vessel by the USCG has been removed.\n\n14Jan09: Forwarded for review\n\n\n\n"}

At approximately 0605 the towing cable of the tug Centurion caught St. Johns River Buoy 59 and the buoy was pulled off station.  The docking pilot was looking out on the starboard bow on deck of the barge.  He could not see buoys on the port side of the tow so he utilized the tugs STACY MCALLISTER AND CENTURION as port side lookouts.  The TUG CENTURION was aft of the TUG STACY MCALLISTER.  After the CENTURION passed buoy 57  the master notified the docking master that they were being set on buoy 59.  The docking master  instructed the STACY to push against the barge to get the CENTURION off of it.  At this point the TUG STACY could not follow the docking master's instructions because it would have caused the TUG STACY to collide with buoy 59, instead the TUG STACY laid beside the barge in order to miss the buoy.

The mast of the KRITI JADE was laid back approximately 30 degrees and the inmarsat antenna was knocked off.  Despite the allision, all navigational  equipment appeared to be working satisfactory.\n\nAll bridge crew members of the KRITI JADE were alcohol tested via breathalyzer by the Coast Guard Station San Francisco Boarding Team.  In addition, all crew members on watch on the bridge were drug tested, including the San Francisco (SF) Bar Pilot and his Apprentice.\n\nThe Investigating Officer (IO) was unable to obtain any Voyage Data Recorder (VDR) data due to the fact that the VDR had been inoperable prior to the KRITI JADE's initial entry into the port of San Francisco.  While the KRITI JADE remained in port following the allision, a radio technician was onboard was able to fix the VDR.  \n\nPreliminary investigation shows that the vessel measurements from the shipbuilder may be incorrect.  It appears that the KRITI JADE's Chief  Officer, 2nd Officer, the SF Pilot and SF Pilot Apprentice all did separate calculations and came up with the same numbers.  According to the Pilot Card onboard, there should have been approximately a 2-5 foot air gap\/clearance under the two bridges.  \n\nSubsequent investigation revealed that the KRITI JADE and its sister-ship had modifications done to the mast during the build in the shipyard and the yard neglected to re-measure the overall height from keel to the top of the mast.  This measurement has been corrected on both vessels.  Based upon the revised measurements, it is clear that there would be inadequate clearance under the bridges for the KRITI JADE to safely pass.

The Grip Lock Connector was attached to a Canflex Lift Bag with 12,000 pound rated lifting capacity.  \n\nThe Job safety Analysis, signed by the divers on May 4, 2009, at 0000, states: \"Never inflate lift bag until rigged to object, 1\" invert line to the top of bag, and Secondary rigging to DMA or stationary object is complete.\"  Note: 'DMA' is a deadman anchor. \n\nInvestigation finds the previous diver did not adequately attach the liftbag rigging; the restraining line was not deployed\/secured to a stationary object, and the inverter line was connected to a PVC pipe that was pulled from the seafloor bottom during an uncontrolled ascent of the liftbag.   \n\nThe diver was wearing a Kirby Morgan Superlite 17C \/ Ultrajewel 601 Reclaim Helmet consisting of a the Divex Ultraflow 601 Demand regulator and Ultrajewel 601 Exhaust Reclaim Regulator connected to a Superlite 17C Helmet. The diver was breathing a 6.5% heliox mixed-gas (6.5% O2) at the time of the uncontrolled ascent. Based on the diver's video, it appears the reclaim system was periodically free-flowing during the previous days.  The helmet appeared to be dry inside when it was removed inside the diving bell after the diver was recovered.\n\nDuring the uncontrolled ascent of the lift bag with Grip Lock Connector attached, it appears the diver was entangled in the PVC pipe and lift bag dump line strap connection. In sum, the diver was involved in an uncontrolled ascent from approximately 212-fsw to approximately 50 to 70 fsw. A pneumo-fathometer reading taken at 0816 indicates the diver was at 70-fsw when communications were ceased with the diver in distress.\n\n\n"}

The ship, carrying crude oil, was assisted in its transit by two tugs - one positioned on either side of the HERO's bow.  While navigating under the Rainbow and Veterans bridges located along the waterway in Port Arthur, Texas, the conning pilot observed that the ship's rudder was not responding to the helmsman. The pilot immediately issued a series of commands that included ordering the tugs to full astern propulsion, the HERO's engines to full astern, and ordering the HERO's crew to drop both port and starboard anchors. These combined actions by the pilot, however, failed to sufficiently stop the vessel's forward momentum enough to avoid an allision with the bridge fendering system and the vessel struck two of the bridge's protective dolphins.  The allision caused significant damage to the bridge's protective dolphins, but the HERO suffered only minor damage. One of the assist tugs similarly suffered only minor damage while the other tug went unscathed.  No injuries were reported to any of the seamen on the HERO or to the seaman on the tugs providing assistance and no pollution was reported.  Shortly after the incident, as the HERO lay anchored near the bridge, the HERO's engineers reportedly determined the cause of the steering casualty, corrected the problem, and the ship was able to complete its transit to the Sun Oil facility in Nederland, Texas without further incident.  \n"}

At approximately 0949, the SEA TOW DUSKY was traveling in the main channel upriver in a northwest direction towards the James River Bridge (US-17\/258\/32) at an approximate speed of 41 mph.  The BASS BOAT was traveling southwest and parallel to the James River Bridge on the bridge's northwest side at approximately 45-51 mph.  At approximately 0950, the SEA TOW DUSKY passed through the James River Bridge's main channel vertical-lift span without slowing down and upon exiting struck the BASS BOAT's port side.  The SEA TOW DUSKY ramped over the BASS BOAT, flipped to port ejecting the operator and capsized.  The operator of a nearby recreational vessel (hereinafter referred to as the \"GOOD SAMARITAN\") heard the collision, responded and retrieved the operator from the water.  The GOOD SAMARITAN notified the Coast Guard and with the assistance of the SEA TOW DUSKY operator, attempted to render assistance to the BASS BOAT, which had come to an abrupt stop and was drifting downriver.  The BASS BOAT was significantly damaged and the passenger was fatally injured.   The operator suffered severe injury.  The SEA TOW DUSKY had hull damage and the operator was seriously injured.\n\nEnforcement recommendations:\n1) Forward evidence to the Virginia Commonwealth Attorney\u2019s Office for their review of possible violation of Virginia Code.\n2) Pursue Personnel Action (S&R) against operator of SEA TOW DUSKY, a credentialed mariner.\n\nNo Safety Recommendations offered.\n\nRecommend this activity be closed.\n"}

The barge was being prepared to be transferred to an Upper River Service tow vessel.  Facility workers had three 1 \u00bd\u201d lines on the port side of the barge tied to the facility mooring system.  Facilities workers then placed a \u00be inch wire rope onto the stern cover top on the starboard side of the barge and to the facility.  This wire rope was used to bring the barge closer towards the facilities pier to allow the tow boat better access to transfer to.  The third line on the stern end was removed to allow the vessel to drift down the pier facing.  Due to high water conditions, the D ring on the cover of the barge broke off, allowing the barge to swing out towards the channel.  This in-turn caused more pressure on the line ropes.  Within in 15 minutes one after another each line broke.  When the second line broke, a facility worker jumped on trying to attach another line before the remaining line parted.  However, the last remaining line broke with the facility worker stranded onboard.  The barge drifted free and traveled down bound on the Upper Mississippi River.  While adrift it struck the Omaha Railroad Bridge north concrete piling side.  The barge bounced off the piling and proceeded under the bridge through the channel.  The barge then proceeded downriver and struck the State High Street Bridge on the left descending side.  A nearby by towing vessel (UGG the TUG), along with Upper River Services, and St Paul Fire boat was able to secure the barge and bring the facility worker off the barge.  The barge received damage to port wing tank and small set in on port stern.  The facility worker received no injuries.\n\n"}

The DELTA MARINER was manned by 18 personnel including the Master and two river pilot advisors. Two additional persons other than crew were also aboard as representatives of the cargo owner. The DELTA MARINER was carrying a cargo of Delta V rocket components. \n\nOn January 26, 2012, at approximately 1950, the DELTA MARINER approached the Eggner\u2019s Ferry Bridge from upstream at a speed of approximately 12 mph with reported weather of overcast conditions, light rain, 15 mph winds, and good visibility. The vessel was travelling with a river current which the vessel\u2019s crew described as \u201cfast\u201d. Sunset occurred at 1709 and no other ambient light from the moon or other landside sources was reported. \n\nThe Eggner\u2019s Ferry Bridge is a girder style two-lane vehicle bridge for U.S. Highway 68 located on mile marker 41.7 of the Tennessee River. The DELTA MARINER\u2019s voyage plan indicated that the vessel intended to pass under the Eggner\u2019s Ferry Bridge thru span B. Span B is the only one of six spans with published navigational and air draft clearances. Spans B, C, D, & E have fixed navigation lighting in place. On the evening of January 26, 2012, only the navigation lights of span E were lit on the Eggner\u2019s Ferry Bridge.   \n\nAt approximately 1953, and within 2.5 miles from the Eggner\u2019s Ferry Bridge, the DELTA MARINER passed the first of four approach buoys to span B.  Immediately afterward, the River Pilot Advisor on watch directed the Chief Mate at the helm to steer the vessel towards the green light marking the middle of span E of the bridge and away from the approach to span B.\n\nAt approximately 1958, and within 2 miles of the Eggner\u2019s Ferry Bridge, both the River Pilot Advisor and the Master gave contradicting navigation commands to the Chief Mate at the helm.  The Third Mate, junior to all officers on the team, never intervened or participated in this exchange despite being in the position of Navigation Officer and charged with the overall navigational safety of the vessel. Instead of attempting to turn or stop the vessel as ordered by the Master, the Chief Mate continued towards span E as directed by the River Pilot Advisor at a speed of approximately 12 mph.\n\nAt approximately 2000, the DELTA MARINER allided with span E of the Eggner\u2019s Ferry Bridge at a speed of approximately 12 mph. The allision dislodged and destroyed a 322 foot section of the bridge and Hwy 68, leaving most of Span E draped over the bow of the DELTA MARINER and anchoring the vessel soon after impact. Vehicle traffic on Hwy 68 was able to stop prior to reaching span E and no injuries or loss of life occurred to either motorists or the vessel\u2019s crew. As a result of the DELTA MARINER\u2019s allision with the Eggner\u2019s Ferry Bridge, the Eggner\u2019s Ferry Bridge sustained $7,000,000 in damage and the DELTA MARINER sustained $500,000 in damage."}

The vessel waited for the flood tide. With the assistance from the UFV ASHLEY GAIL (O.N. 636187) the vessel successfully floated free with no observed damage to the vessel or injury to the crew. The vessel transisted to Newport News harbor and was pulled out to be inspected.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, it was determined that due to the nature of manning requirements on scallop fishing vessels, it is common for a single operator to be in control of the vessel for up to 16 hours per day during a fishing trip. Since the vessel is limited to 8 persons on board, operators usually man the vessel with members who will be conducting fishing operations. This could lead to fatigue of the operator at the helm.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the grounding of the vessel on the rocky seabed. This was followed by damage to the vessel's hull paint, indent on the keel, port & starboard sides, with damage to the engine keel cooler and kortz nozzle, rudder shoe, lower pintle bearing and propeller. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty were: (1) manning limitations in place and (2) fatigue of the operator."}

Alarm activation caused the Master to shut down the port outboard jet drive and its Main Diesel Engine (MDE) to troubleshoot the problem. The GOLDEN GATE was just leaving the dock at Pier 41 in San Francisco with 35 persons on board when the incident occurred.  \nInvestigation by TGGB's internal mechanical engineer diagnosed the problem and found it to be a loose fitting on a hydraulic hose. This loose fitting caused approximately 5 gallons of hydraulic oil to enter the water and forced the shutdown of the MDE and jet drive. The hydraulic hose is part of the hydraulic control for the jet drive and it is external to the hull of the vessel. It is unknown why the fitting became loose but, speculated that it was due to normal vibration and cavitations associated with the vessel. The company is working on corrective measures to prevent this in the future by means of preventive maintenance and or environmentally safe hydraulic fluid.

{"activity_id":5175339,"brief":"On the evening of July 4, 2015 at approximately 2126 Eastern Daylight Savings Time, a rented 24 foot pontoon boat (GERALD, KY0704UG) was traveling down-river with nine persons on board.  The vessel was transiting the area near the I-65 northbound bridge construction project, Ohio River mile marker (MM) 603; it was between the Big Four Pedestrian Bridge and the I-65\/Kennedy Bridge.  The operator attempted to make a turn near tower #5 of the bridge construction project, when he attempted this maneuver the vessel allided (a collision with a fixed object) with the bridge pier footer.  The allision involved the port side of the vessel and the up-river side of the pier footer.  The current caused the vessel to become pinned against the bridge pier footer.  The operator asked his passengers to assist in freeing the vessel by pushing the vessel away from the bridge pier footer.  The vessel then slid astern by-way of propulsion or river current and allided with a moored spud barge, KS 395 (CG1355250).  When the vessel allided with the barge, the port stern became wedged under the raked bow of the barge, the vessel then capsized.  The operator directed the adult passengers to get all the children off onto the barge; three children were able to board the barge, six other passengers went into the water.  One adult male was able to climb onto the barge while the other five persons were missing, of those five other persons there were two children and three adults.  When the vessel began its voyage and departed the marina, it was stocked with personal floatation devices (life jackets).  Two passengers, children under the age of 12, were wearing personal floatation devices in accordance with state and federal regulations.  It cannot be confirmed if the personal floatation devices were correctly fastened or the proper size.  All victims were recovered over a three day period; none were recovered with personal floatation devices on their person and all were deceased.  One of the recovered victims was under the age of 12; all of the recovered personal floatation devices were CG approved TYPE II (adult) and TYPE III (children).\n\nAs a result of this investigation the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision with the I-65 northbound bridge pier footer known as tower #5, caused by the operator's decision to make a turn to port instead of starboard.  This was followed by the allision with a moored work barge and eventual capsizing of the vessel.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include; (1) the river state, (2) the experience of the operator, (3) the vessels load and engine size, and (4) personal protective equipment."}

While still above the Beardstown RR Bridge, at approximately MM 92, the Pilot (relief captain) requested, via VHF channel 16, an opening of the bridge. The bridge is located at MM 88.9 on the Illinois River and has a single horizontal channel lift span. The bridge cannot be visually observed from the Bridge Tender's office, approximately a mile away. The Bridge Tender\u2019s Office has two desks: one containing the bridge control console (containing the bridge control box, VHF radio, video feed, and RADAR) and one containing all of the Internal Yard Train and Maintenance Controller equipment for carrying out those responsibilities. While sitting at one desk, the Bridge Tender has his or her back to the other desk.\n\nThe Bridge Tender flipped the bridge opening switch on the bridge control console (also called the bridge control box) to the \"open\" position and radioed the vessel that \"the bridge was on the way up\". The bridge\u2019s channel lift span did not completely open, it only opened approx \u00be of the way. The Bridge Tender never verified (via the video monitor or the bridge control console lights) that the bridge\u2019s channel lift span actually opened all the way.\n\nWhen the UTV WAYNE P LAGRANGE got closer to the bridge, the Pilot realized that the bridge was not fully open but was unable to stop the vessel\u2019s forwarded momentum (due to the strong river current and the vessel's speed) and it allided with the bridge\u2019s channel lift span.  All of the vessel's navigational, lighting, and electronic equipment atop the vessel's pilothouse was sheared off.\n\nThe reason the bridge only partially opened was due to the tripping of a bridge seat electrical relay which is located on the bridge itself and senses that the bridge is fully open (seated).  After the allision, the bridge seat relay was reset and the bridge functioned normally. The cause of the bridge seat relay failure (tripping) was never determined. The vessel pushed in below the bridge, and after temporary repairs were made, was allowed to continue its transit."}

While pushing two loaded hopper barges, the upper pilothouse of the DANNY BRADFORD struck worker occupied scaffolding located underneath the center span of the Eads Bridge.  Weather conditions at the time of the allision consisted of overcast skies with winds at 7 knots, gusting to 11 knots, from the south\/southwest.  The UMR in the area of St. Louis, MO was in extreme high water  with the UMR St. Louis gauge, located at the Eads Bridge, reading approximately 33 feet and falling.  \n\nThe Eads Bridge was completed in July 1874 and was designed with a center span width of 517 feet between bridge piers. This center span serves as the primary channel for river traffic.  The vertical clearance at the center of the main span is normally 88.6 feet minus the reading of the UMR St. Louis gauge. Due to the curved design, a decreasing vertical clearance away from the center follows the supporting steelwork as it curves downward towards each supporting bridge pier.  Due to extreme high water on 16 JUL 2015, and with the presence of scaffolding added under the bridge, the vertical clearance at the center of the main arch was approximately 54.8 feet decreasing to about one foot at the bridge piers.  \n\nUndergoing a long term maintenance project that began in 2012, this project involved worker occupied enclosed scaffolding that extended downward under the bridge.  The project site was an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulated workplace, while navigation safety issues specific to the bridge maintenance project were regulated by the Eighth Coast Guard District Western Rivers Bridge Branch.  The intent of the conditions issued by the Eighth District Western Rivers Bridge Branch was to limit vessel traffic horizontally on the water whereby traffic would remain centered in the middle 300 feet of the center span.  \n\nOn 16 JUL 2015, at approximately 1400, the DANNY BRADFORD with two hopper barges loaded with petroleum coke, departed Beelman River Terminal located at mile 182.3 UMR left descending bank (LDB), heading southbound to Buzzi St. Louis Dock at mile 176 UMR right descending bank (RDB).  Approximately 2000 feet upbound of the Eads Bridge, the master of the DANNY BRADFORD realized the vessel and barges were not lined up correctly to pass under the middle 300 feet of the center span and began backing and steering to try to correct the approach but without success.  As a result, the vessel passed under the Eads Bridge outside of the middle 300 foot navigational opening intended for vessel traffic.  As there was not enough vertical clearance to pass under the bridge outside of this window, the pilothouse of the DANNY BRADFORD struck the scaffolding at the same spot a bridge maintenance worker was located resulting in immediate death to the worker."}

As the vessel passed under the bridge the master noticed the tow was sliding more than anticipated. The mate engaged the engines in reverse to stop the headway motion; this caused the starboard rear barge, BKM4510B, to allide with the west pillar on the bridge. \n\nAfter the allision, the Mate engaged the engines in order to clear the bridge. After clearing the bridge the Mate alerted the bridge tender of the allision. The vessels crew inspected the barge for damage and found it sustained only minor cosmetic damage to its starboard rear not needing repair. The barge tender did an initial inspection of the bridge with no noted damage. The Norfolk Southern railroad supervisor arrived on scene at approximately 0440, inspected the bridge and found that the bridge sustained no visible or structural damage. The HONEST BOB continued on to Demopolis with no other incident."}
{"activity_id":5731823,"brief":"At approximately 0015 CST on September 09, 2015, the Uninspected Towing Vessel (UTV) CROSBY COMMANDER (O.N. 1163372) allided barge OCEANUS (O.N. 1233982) with the Houma Navigation Canal Bridge in Houma, LA. At the time of the allision, the UTV CROSBY COMMANDER (O.N. 592410) was moored on the centerline stern of the barge, acting as a guide vessel. UTV MISS STACIE (O.N. 622585) was not moored to the barge but forward of the tow acting as a scout vessel.\n \nWhile transiting southbound in the GICW, the tow became misaligned as it passed through the Houma Navigational Canal Bridge. The Master of UTV CROSBY COMMANDER tried to correct the mistake but was too late and the OCEANUS struck the northwest side of the fenders.  The Master of UTV CROSBY COMMANDER then tried to compensate for the allision and struck the northeast side of the fenders. The barge sustained $16,000 in damage and the bridge sustained $85,000 in damage totaling $101,000 in damages.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was an allision from OCEANUS, which was pulled in tow by CROSBY COMMANDER, with the Houma Navigational Canal Bridge. The subsequent event was damage to the port side of OCEANUS and damage to the northeast side of the bridge. CROSBY CARRIER attempted to realign the tug and tow but overcompensated resulting in the second subsequent event of an allision with the northwest side of the bridge. The starboard side of the barge was undamaged but the bridge sustained damage to its northwest fender system. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) mismatch between the Captain and the environment of a large tow through a narrow bridge channel, (2) execution error-attention failure of the misaligned tug and tow through the bridge, and (3) inadequate shiphanding of a tug with a large tow."}

{"activity_id":5741184,"brief":"At approximately 0318 EDT on October 09, 2015, the tank vessel QI LIN ZUO was transiting the Arther Kill in the Port of New York and New Jersey, when her INMARSAT C antenna mast struck the Arther Kill Rail Bridge. \n\nThe allision bent the steel mast backwards and removed the INMARSAT C antenna. The bridge was surveyed after the allision and was found undamaged. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that an inaccurate air draft measurement was reported to the pilot prior to transit. This discrepency was a result of the vessel operator's failure to account for the full height of the INMARSAT C antenna mast. The mast is designed to retract downwards if needed. The air draft measurement provided to the pilot was correct only if the mast was retracted. On this transit, the mast was not retracted, consequently the air draft reported to the pilot was incorrect, and the mast struck the bridge."}
{"activity_id":5742735,"brief":"On October 9, 2015 at approximately 0645 local time the Tug CAPT JOHNNY (O.N. 299649) was pushing the gravel barge DMT 4005 (O.N. 665826) ahead when it allided with the fendering system to the South Norfolk Jordan Bridge.  The tug reportedly had to unexpectedly slow down due to a recreational sailing vessel that was transiting in front of the tow.  The tug utilized its horn in an attempt to hail the sailing vessel after the vessel failed to respond to VHF communications.  The tug\u2019s horn became stuck in the actuated position, leading to a loss of control air and throttle control.  This equipment failure influenced the tug's ability to maneuver in the prevailing sea conditions (currents), resulting in the starboard bow of the barge alliding with seven eight foot wooden planks on the bridge\u2019s fendering system.  The initiating event identified in conjunction with this incident was failure of the actuating valve for the vessel's air horn, which became stuck in the open position resulting in the subsequent loss of control air necessary for throttle control.  This ultimately led to a reduction in maneuverability event followed by the allision with the South Norfolk Jordan Bridge fendering system.\n\nIt is recommended that this investigation activity be closed without a referral to enforcement."}

{"activity_id":5752176,"brief":"On October 27, 2015 at approximately 1215 CST, the Uninspected Towing Vessel MISS EDMAY, pushing ahead two barges, allided with the Bayou Boeuf Railroad Bridge fendering system. The allision occurred as the MISS EDMAY was heading southbound on Bayou Boeuf, while pushing ahead two loaded barges, the lead barge 2015 (35 ft wide) and the SMI-59 (40 ft wide). As the vessel began to transit through the railroad bridge, the lead barge cleared the bridge. As the second barge approached the starboard bridge dolphin (fendering system), the starboard bow of the second barge allided with the fendering system.  Due to the difference in size of the two barges, a corner was created where the two barges meet and upon going through the bridge, the barge got pushed to the starboard side by the current and the starboard corner of the aft barge (SMI-59) allided with the bridge fender. Upon impact, the port side wires connecting the two barges parted, but safety ropes prevented the barges from swinging out of control.\n\nThe Bayou Boeuf Railroad Bridge fendering system received minor damage. The operation of the bridge was not affected. Neither the barges, nor the vessel received any damage."}

{"activity_id":5756468,"brief":"On November 3, 2015, at approximately 1000 local mean time (LMT), the US Coast Guard Certificated Army Corps of Engineer Dredge Barge MURDEN (O.N. 1235517) was transiting southbound in the Virginia Intercoastal Waterway (ICW) en route to Wanchees, NC. The Captain had assumed the first navigational watch after the vessel got underway from Fort Norfolk, VA.  The Mate was also on the bridge serving as lookout and assistant to the Captain while transiting in the southern branch of the Elizabeth River, an area of high traffic congestion and bridges.  The mate stayed on the bridge as the MURDEN transitioned into the Virginia Intracoastal Waterway (ICW).  At approximately 1\/2 mile south of the Centerville Bridge, in the VA ICW, the vessel struck an unknown submerged object.  The object damaged the starboard side hydraulic motor on the azimuth drive unit.  The motor leaked approximately 2-5 gallons of hydraulic fluid into the ICW.  The starboard side azimuth drive was secured and the Captain of the MURDEN made the decision to continue towards Wanchees, NC using only the port engine and bow thrusters.  This decision was made out of concern that it would be safer to transit in an area of less traffic congestion then turning around and heading back into Norfolk.  The Captain originally estimated that the cost of labor and material to repair the starboard motor would be approximately $50,000.\n\nThe dredge barge made it safely to Wanchees, NC where it was hauled out for dry dock.  It was discovered that the steering pump had broken loose from the outdrive unit.  The damaged unit was replaced by a fully operational spare unit.  The total cost of repairs was $70,000.00 and were affected by members of the Army Corps of Engineers repair yard.  These repairs were monitored by Coast Guard marine inspectors assigned to Nags Head, VA.  \n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision with the unknown submerged object in the VA ICW.  Subsequently, this damaged the starboard Azimuth drive unit beyond operation.  This negatively impacted the maneuverability of the vessel and it was forced to continue on its voyage to Wanchees, NC for repairs on one engine. The main causal factor in this incident is the heavy industrial activity on the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River, NC that creates much debris being flushed from the banks into the water. This debris is often submerged and not within the visibility limitations of operators. \n\nIn accordance with the memorandum of understanding between the US Coast Guard (USCG) and the Army Corp of Engineers (ACOE), requesting their ACOE vessels to be certificated and subsequent marine casualties investigated by the USCG, this incident was investigated by the USCG and it is recommended that this case be closed without a referral for enforcement."}

UTV was only pushing one barge, moving it from the fleet to the facility to be discharged. Allision was due to dense fog that came on during transit and the captain reported the center span lights of the bridge were extinguished. Captain of UTV had posted two lookouts on the tow, who afterwards reported only seeing the green light of the alternate span during transit.  UTV continued to destination Marathon Refinery after completing a visual inspection of the bridge and barge.

The allision ocurred as the Sarah Andrie was passing the western bridge protection cell, the starboard bow of the A-390 made contact with the cell pushing the barge into the eastern cell. The port bow of the A-340 made contact with the cell at a speed of 5 kts. The damage to the A-390 was a dent 4 ft by 5 ft in the port bow. At the time of the allision the A-390 was empty of any product. The damage was forward of the collision bulkhead. \n\nThe master and crew stated that the wind was blowing from the SW 10-15 kts. The master said that the combination of the wind and tight clearance between the cells (1 ft either side) effected his steering and blew him onto the cells causing damage to the A390. \n\nAs a result of the investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was a combination to the 10-15 kt wind effect on the barges along with the extremely tight passage between the protection cells. The causal factors that contributed to the casualty include: (1) excessive winds in the vicinity of the tow as it entered the bridge cells, (2) The master misjudging his speed as he entered the protection cell area, (3) Loss of sitional awareness of the master when he stated that \"he usually piviots off of the eastern cell into the cell area and swings into the protection area\".

{"activity_id":5782234,"brief":"On December 14, 2015, at approximately 1715 LMT, the tug JACK HOLLAND (ON# 669003) was pushing the empty freight barge NTC-50 (ON# 531237) northbound on the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River, transiting through the Gilmerton Bridge Span.  During the transit through the bridge span the barge allided with the eastern side of the fendering system.  The Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River north of the Gilmerton Bridge is a known problem area due to a sharp almost 90 degree bend in the river that exists . The mate-on-watch attempted to navigate closer to the port side of the channel due to two reasons, the first being the sharp bend in the channel immediately following the bridge and second, because the weather and waterway conditions was pushing the tug and barge to the starboard side of the channel. At the time of the casualty the current was ebbing, and the wind was gusting to the east at approximately 10-15 knots.  Also, the 324 foot NTC-50 was empty which caused the barge to have a very large sail area.  The wind gusts combined with the increased sail area of the empty barge set the vessels to the starboard side of the channel as the mate-on-watch was approaching the bridge span.  Once the mate-on-watch realized that an allision was inevitable, he made evasive maneuvers to ensure the barge made a controlled landing on the easterly side of the Gilmerton Bridge fendering system. The barge slid down the side of the fendering system and exited the bridge span. The tug did not make contact with the bridge fendering system.  No damage was reported to the bridge, fendering system or tug and barge.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was a lack of vessel maneuverability, which resulted from a combination of weather factors of an ebb tide and strong gusting wind, the large sail area from the unloaded barge, and the significantly reduced navigational channel at the Gilmerton Bridge Span.  This combination negatively impacted the mate's approach, which resulted in an allision with the fendering system."}

After receiving task direction from the shift supervisor, the River Construction crew got underway from the inboard side of the Magnolia fleet dock barge. Two crewmembers were inside the cabin and one remained on the aft boat deck. \n\nAs the MV PINTAIL departed the Magnolia Fleet dock barge, the uninspected towing vessel CAPT GEORGE BRUMLEY and tow of one sludge barge was positioned off the outboard side of the Magnolia Fleet dock barge with its engines engaged and propeller turning. There was a gap of approximately 30 feet between the stern of the UTV CAPT GEORGE BRUMLEY and the bow of the Carline dock barge immediately down river from the Magnolia Fleet dock barge. \n   \nThe MV PINTAILs outboard engine stalled as the vessel passed behind the UTV CAPT GEORGE BRUMLEY. Without propulsion, the MV PINTAIL drifted down river with the river current and propeller wash until alliding with the bow of the Carline dock barge. Pinned against the dock barge, the MV PINTAIL started listing to the port side. As the vessel rolled, the crewmember on the aft boat deck jumped off the port side of the vessel and began swimming. Moments later, the MV PINTAIL capsized with two crewmembers inside the vessels cabin. \n\nThe MV PINTAIL drifted down river with its bow submerged and stern raised vertical out of the water. The two crewmembers escaped from the MV PINTAILs cabin and clung to the vessels hull.  The crewmember that had jumped off the vessel drifted with the river current and was last seen swimming towards the river bank in between the stern of the Carline dock barge and the bow of a Bisso dock barge immediately down river. The MV PINTAIL drifted alongside the UTV BOBCAT moored to the Bisso dock barge, and two crewmembers climbed out of the water on to the UTV BOBCAT.

{"activity_id":5793208,"brief":"At approximately 1000 CST on December 28,2015, the uninspected towing vessel J. A. WARD pushing ahead 6 barges (5 empty open hoppers; 1 spud barge) (tow dimensions were 2 barges wide by 3 barges long) had its stern port barge, RM 3351, lightly rub the Bayou Dularge Bridge Fender System.  The allision occurred while the J.A. WARD was headed west bound along the GIWW toward the Atchafalaya River just north of Morgan City to Hot Springs, Louisiana.\n\nThe bridge fender system was lightly rubbed on its south fender causing no damage to either the barge or the fender system. The tow's forward speed was approximately 0.7 mph when it lightly allided the fender works.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event was the allision of the tow's port stern corner of barge, RM 3351, with the south bridge fender works. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:  1) Tow's forward speed was not enough to offset strong sudden southerly wind gusts near 25 mph that pushed the tow's stern port corner onto the bridge's south fender works; 2) Bridge span width was 125 feet and the tow's dimensions were 70 feet wide by near 600 feet long. This allowed little room to compensate for sudden changes in weather conditions, which occurred in this instance; 3) Vessel master just got underway about a quarter mile east from the bridge fender system after navigational curfew ended. This caused the vessel to not have enough forward speed or headway to counter the sudden strong wind gusts as the vessel entered the bridge fender opening."}
{"activity_id":5793539,"brief":"08JAN2016: M\/V CMA CGM ALMAVIVA was transiting outbound through the Arthur Kills and under the Bayonne Bridge when the port inmarsat c antenna #2 made contact with the construction net of the Bayonne Bridge. The contact was enough to pull down the antenna, shattering the antenna cone when it fell to the deck of the vessel.  Vessel was directed to anchor in Gravesend Bay with IO and MI dispatched to investigate. Airdraft of the vessel was 148.7 ft and the airdraft for the bridge at the time of incident was 152.2 ft. giving the vessel a clearance of 3.5 ft. However, after reviewing witness statement from the Master of the vessel, VTS track and video of the vessel transiting under the bridge, it was determined that the Pilot had cut the corner of the outbound turn in the Newark Basin and had the vessel transiting under the northern part of the bridge instead of going directly under the high point Pilot Flag. This subsequently dropped the air draft clearance by approximately 3 ft. and had the vessel with 1\/2 foot of clearance. Furthermore, the video captures that the vessel was turning hard to port and subsequently listing to starboard which would have made up the clearance distance resulting in the portside inmarsat c antenna #2 making contact with the construction net of the Bayonne bridge. No damage to the bridge was sustained as per the Bayonne Bridge Port Authority and Form B was issued to the vessel for repair of the inmarsat c antenna.\n\nAs the vessel was north of the mid-channel by approximately 30 yards, it should have been calculated that this maneuver would reduce air clearance and this should have been taken into account by the Pilot. At the time of the incident, there was no precise method of computing the true height of the Bayonne Bridge and its suspended hazards. Subsequent meetings and conversations since incident between all parties should help mitigate the hazards of bridge strike allisions while the bridge undergoes re-construction."}

At the time of the incident, the AMERICAN TRADER was being towed by the WEDELL FOSS and HENRY FOSS from the West Hylebos moorings to American Construction facility. The WEDELL FOSS was on the port bow of the AMERICAN TRADER and the HENRY FOSS was on the stern on a single line moving port\/starboard. At approximately 30 to 40 feet in to the crossing, the mate onboard the WEDELL FOSS noticed that the AMERICAN TRADER was not square in the horizontal clearance (150 feet).  The mate gave the order to check the stern to starboard, but did not catch the swing soon enough.  The AMERICAN TRADER's starboard forward ladder which extends about a foot off the hull allided with the Hylebos Bridge shear wall. The Hylebos bridge tender conducted inspection and discovered only minor damage to the west side protective wall. The Hylebos Bridge remains fully operational.

{"activity_id":5795861,"brief":"At approximately 0500 on 9 AUG 2015, the UTV HERITAGE (240322) allided with the Popps Ferry Bridge. The vessel was pushing 5 barges east bound through the Big Lake from Gulfport, MS to Moss Point, MS. After clearing the bridge, the tug reversed and reposition in order to navigate the waterway properly, and the stern starboard barge pushed against the bridge dolphin piling which resulted in the dolphin being damaged and pushed over. The barge sustained no damage.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) winds out of the northeast at 15-20 knots, (2) flooding tide at 3-5 knots, and (3) a difficult waterway to maneuver as vessel's were forced to make an \"S\" turn, first to port then starboard quickly."}
{"activity_id":5795989,"brief":"On 12JAN15 at approximately 0400, the UTV HORTENSE B INGRAM was pushing 10 open hopper barges southbound near MM 106, LMR. Upon passing the turn near MM 109, the UTV attempted to get back towards the center of the channel to pass beneath the Huey P. Long Bridge. Due to the high river stage and the current pushing towards the eastbank of the river, the UTV's bow began angling towards the eastbank putting the whole tow diagonal in the river. The Pilot attempted to maneuver the vessel so it was centered up prior to passing under the bridge but was unsuccessful. As the tow passed beneath the bridge, the port stern barge in the tow (IN 155417 loaded with coal), allided with the bridge. The Pilot called for assistance following the allision, 05 tugs responded and helped the UTV HORTENSE B INGRAM push up against the westbank of the river. The IN 155417 sustained damage beneath the waterline which divers estimated to be a 1 foot crack in the lap of the bilge knuckle, which affected both the #2 and #3 port voids. Damage estimate reported on CG 2692 was recorded as $100k, however, $20k of those costs were attributed to drydocking, salvage.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the strong current pushing the vessel off track from its intended course. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include the fact that the pilot made a turn just prior to getting off course. While navigating this turn in the river, the pilot tried to maintain a position close to the westbank, however, the current was pushing strongly to the eastbank. As a result, when the pilot cleared the turn in the river he was already too far towards the eastbank and did not have sufficient time to center up in the channel before passing beneath the bridge."}

The master attempted to maneuver the tow through the Florence Highway Bridge middle raised span, but the tow started to miss align. The master placed throttles full astern in efforts to correct the tow and the port lead barge allided with the left descending bank protection cell of Florence Highway Bridge. As a result of the bridge allision 4 barges were damaged and 9 barges broke loose and drifted downstream from the bridge. The Illinois River IVO of the Florence Highway Bridge was in major flood stage and the Master of the vessel misjudged the affects of the extra strong current associated with major flooding. The breakaway barges were collected by the Master of the JAMES F. NEAL with assistance from nearby vessels."}

As the master manuevered his tow through the bridge a strong ebb tide began to set him to the starboard side of the channel. Sensing this, the master requested the bridge tender lift the bridge again for him to back down and reset his tow into the channel on a better heading. However, he was unable to make the correction prior to alliding the starboard stern of his starboard barge, MTC 0016, with the piling cluster in front of the fendering system. As a result of the allision, the piling cluster was knocked slighlty over from its original position but no damage was done to the barge and no other incidents resulted from this casualty."}
{"activity_id":5797582,"brief":"Downbound en route New Orleans, the CYNTHIA G ESPER struck the left channel span of the Hwy 49 Bridge at Helena, AR, mile marker 661.7 on the LMR.  The tow of 4 loaded denatured ethanol barges (red flag), broke up and went adrift down river.  The CYNTHIA was able to retain one barge (STC 3015), with minimal damage and regain control.  Assist vessels were able to recover the other barges.  Two barges sustained leaks to cargo tanks into the wing voids (SCF 1204 and WTC 3010).  The SCF 1204 became partially sunk after the vessels pushed it as far up the left descending bank as possible to secure it at mile marker 664.

{"activity_id":5798182,"brief":"At approximately 1043am on January 10, 2016 the M\/V Park City experienced an electrical fire in the galley. The fire was contained inside a distribution panel on the starboard side of the galley. Once galley workers noticed fire and smoke coming out of the panel they notified crewmembers.  The Chief Engineer turned off power to the galley and a crewmember came and used CO2 to extinguish the fire and stayed for fire watch. He was relieved by the mate, and the fire reflashed two more times, finally being extingushed at approximately 1048am. The cause of the fire was found to be holes in the top of the distribution panel that allowed water intrusion into the panel. The water intrusion was caused by a hole on the upper deck which dripped water down onto the electrical wiring, which then dripped thru the top of the panel. The entire panel was replaced and the hole on the upper deck was repaired."}

The GOSPEL LIGHT departed from Lake Charles on January 15, 2016 and was heading east enroute to American Commercial Lines in Harahan, LA.\n\nThe West Larose Bridge sustained damage to the fendering system and the red navigation light. A damage estimate was not given because the West Larose Bridge is currently undergoing a $25M overhaul. The tug and barge did not sustain any damage.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the material failure of the wiring for the steering breaker which subsequently caused GOSPEL LIGHT to lose steering.  The next subsequent event was the allision with the West Larose Bridge which subsequently caused damage to the bridge.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the communication error in which the oncoming, new operator was unaware of previous trips from the breaker that caused the vessel to lose steering, (2) the routine (adaptation) planning error in which the crew continued to operate the vessel without properly repairing the tripped breaker after the first malfunction, and (3) the maintenance\/repair plan for ensuring the vessel's safety after a marine casualty occurs."}

CRUM was DB at ILR MM 151 pushing two red flag barges (MM 20, empty) and (MM 95, loaded)) when the UTV attempted to make a controlled landing on the Union Pacific Railroad Bridge (aka Pekin Railroad Bridge). This is a documented, known, obstructive bridge under the TRUMAN-HOBBS Act. There was a strong current with flowing river ice. The barges were breasted with MM-95 on the stbd side. The stbd bow corner of barge MM-95 glanced off of the RDB fending system causing no damage; however, the impact caused the tow to veer to the left and the port bow of barge MM-20 to allid with the LDB shear fencing. This allision resulted in multiple broken wooden fencing timbers and pilings. The UTV was authorized to proceed southbound to Havana, IL where IO\u2019s could safely board the vessel.  No damage was sustained to the barges. This vessel operates on a semi-dedicated route and the Pilot stated that he had probably transited the bridge 30 times in 2015 and was familiar with the intricacies of this bridge. The wooden bridge fendering system was damaged; estimated cost of repair is currently $300,000.

ROBINSON (O.N. 1257752) was heading northbound on the Des Plaines river pushing 2 barges (GM 1011 & GM 3000) when the GM 1011 made contact with the McDonough St. bridge protective cell. The starboard side mid-ships of the GM 1011 made contact. The master stated that winds were sustaining at 15 kts and gusting to 23 at the time of the allision. He said the wind caught him on the port side and blew the tow on to the protective cell. The cell sustained cosmetic damage to the lower rubber portion and the barge did not sustain any damage.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the gusty winds in the vicinity of the McDonough St. bridge."}
{"activity_id":5825327,"brief":"On March 1, 2016, the empty jumbo hopper barge SJ-199 (O.N. 665820) allided with a charted mooring dolphin at the NuStar Energy facility in Chesapeake, VA and the North Landing Bridge at 0317 and 0322 LMT, respectively.  The allisions occurred while the tug KODIAK (O.N. 637055) was pushing the SJ-199 under the control of the Mate.  The tug and barge were underway on the North Landing River headed north bound from Edenton, NC to Baltimore, MD at a speed of approximately 3.5 knots.  The Mate was operating from the lower wheelhouse during both allisions, with minimal visibility beyond the bow of the barge due to its size.  There was no lookout posted on the barge.  The Mate did not report the marine casualties to the Coast Guard and continued transiting northbound following the allisions.\n\nThe allisions resulted in the North Landing Bridge operating on a limited opening schedule, and damage to the mooring dolphin.  The initial damaged estimate was $500,000; however, the most recent repair estimate for the Bridge and the mooring dolphin is approximately $277,322 as of December 13, 2016.  The SJ-199 was also damaged as a result of the allision with the bridge, and was repaired at a cost of $30,996.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the SJ-199 alliding with the mooring dolphin at the NuStar Energy facility mooring dolphin. This was followed by a second allision with the North Landing Bridge.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the lack of training for the Mate, (2) the Mate\u2019s failure to post a proper lookout (3) the lack of recent experience operating as a Mate, (4) the Mate\u2019s failure to operate from the upper wheelhouse, (5) the marine employer\u2019s failure to verify the Mate\u2019s employment history upon hiring him, (6) and the National Maritime Center\u2019s failure to verify the Mate\u2019s sea time upon submission for an increased endorsement as a Mate in charge of a towing vessel.  Fatigue, weather, and equipment failure were all considered in the course of this investigation, but were not found to be causal factors."}

{"activity_id":5839957,"brief":"On March 6, 2016, a plastic antenna on the top mast of the foreign flagged tank ship SITEAM ANJA struck the Castleton-On-Hudson Highway bridge while the vessel was transiting Northbound on the Hudson River. No damage to the bridge was reported, while the plastic dome on the vessel\u2019s INMARSAT C antenna was broken off by the contact. There were no injuries, pollution, or other damages as a result of this casualty.\n\nInvestigating Officers from Sector New York attended the bridge, and verified that there were no obstructions hanging from the bridge or reducing the charted air clearance. The bridge is midway through a wo year painting project, and the navigation channel has been reduced in width from 360 feet to 210 feet. This reduction has been promulgated in the Local Notice to Mariners, and was current as of the NTM issued for week 9 of 2016. Within the reduced-width channel, there is no charted reduction in air clearance below the bridge. This was verified on scene, with all scaffolding and equipment in place higher than the bottom structures of the bridge within the reduced channel. The vessel\u2019s Master and Pilot were aware of the reduced-width channel under the bridge, and navigated the vessel within this channel. \n\nInvestigators also attended the vessel pierside in Albany, NY. Documentation onboard indicated that the INMARSAT C antenna was included in the keel-to-masthead measurement used to calculate air draft. Based on this measurement and the vessel\u2019s ballasting arrangement, the pilot calculated the vessel\u2019s air draft at 132.3 feet, and used this measurement for bridge clearance measurements.\n\nThe air clearance under the Castleton-on-Hudson bridge is charted at 135 feet from Mean High Water. There is no NOAA water level measurement available for this location, however NOAA does promulgate tide predictions for Hudson, NY, which is just upstream of the bridge. According to the tide prediction, on March 6, 2016 there was a high tide at approximately 1346. Review of the tide prediction table indicates that the water level at the time of the allision (1444), was approximately 5 feet higher than Mean Lower Low Water. Using these numbers, it was established that the vessel transited under the bridge anticipating approximately 2.9 feet of clearance between the highest mast and the bridge. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that it is most likely that the actual water level at the time of the allision was higher than the predicted level. In the absence of actual measurements, the actual water level cannot be verified. However, there is no evidence that the measurements that the vessel provided for the air draft calculation were inaccurate. As a result, no enforcement action was taken against the vessel. Ideally, the Pilot and Master would wait until a lower water level to transit under a bridge. Unfortunately, the Hudson River transit has many points where there are restrictions on draft and\/or air draft. Although vessels can speed up or slow down to change the time that they encounter a restriction, large seagoing vessels cannot stop and wait at most points in the transit, since the navigable waterway is too narrow to swing at anchor. With a vessel this large operating with such small margins for error, even a relatively minor deviation from the predicted water level would have been enough to result in the antenna contacting the bridge. By process of elimination, higher than predicted water level is the most likely pre-condition that led to this casualty."}

The UTV PACIFIC DAWN reported another UTV, STEPHEN R WARDEN, heading in the opposite direction came within 50 ft. of the UTV PACIFIC DAWN. The wake created by the UTV STEPHEN R WARDEN caused water wash on the deck of the UTV PACIFIC DAWN and the forward line affixed to the T\/B SEA CREST to part. Once the forward line parted, the bow began to veer away from the UTV PACIFIC DAWN and the remaining two lines parted. Shortly after the lines parted the port side of the barge struck the center piling of the Huey P. Long bridge. The barge was collected by the UTV PACIFIC DAWN and brought to Buck Kreihs facility where surveyors found a 2 inch hole in the bilge knuckle of the #7 void which allowed water ingress.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the parting of the three tow lines between the UTV PACIFIC DAWN and TB SEA CREST."}

The river stage was at 26.96 on the Cape G gauge. Reported weather was 42 degrees with 9 miles of visibility and winds were 13 MPH WSW with gust up to 29. The current was flowing at 3 to 4 mph. The vessel was traveling at 8 mph. The Pilot was on watch when he attempted to navigate a 110 degree turn and then attempted to pass through the Thebes Railroad bridge span. The Pilot was flanking the bend, then began pushing ahead to give headway.  To counteract the slide, he pointed the head of the tow towards the left hand pier. His speed over ground was 8 mph. The head of the tow became hung up in slack water under the point so he started to back down hard on the starboard MDE but the head of the tow continued to hang up in slack water and began to swing to port.  The vessel and tow continued down bound when the port side of the tow struck the left hand pier of the Thebes R\/R Bridge span causing all 30 barges to be set adrift.  The barge AEP 3117 sank on the bridge pier and barge LF 114 sank in the middle of the channel at MM 42 and eventually recovered.  The other 28 barges grounded further down river, with 16 total barges sustaining minor damaged. \n\nCoast Guard investigation revealed the initiating event to be the allision with the bridge pier at Thebes Railroad Bridge located at mm 43.7 Upper Mississippi River. Casual factors include 1) Human error exacerbated by pilot's unfamiliarity with the vessel. Pilot was not familiar with the vessels turn rate and mistimed his approach by allowing the head of the tow to get in slack water which did not allow for the head to swing at a faster rate; 2) Waterway condition.  Pilot did not account properly for the decrease turn rate from slack water.  River stage was 26.96 ft with 9 miles of visibility and winds were 13 MPH WSW."}

The vessel was towing astern the dredge TANGIER  SOUND (O.N. 297588), which had a small undocumented work barge and work tug MISS ASHLEY (O.N. 1268569) tied off to its starboard side. The uninspected towing vessel MAVERICK (O.N. 510611) was positioned off the TANGIER SOUND\u2019s port stern to serve as an assist vessel as directed by the master of the SHARPS ISLAND. While making the voyage the small work barge allided with the west fendering wall of Gilmerton Bridge resulting in approximately $23,000 in damage to the fendering wall and MAVERICK. \n\nThe small work barge struck a section of rubber fender on the lower portion of the west fender wall, resulting in approximately $5,000 in damage to the fender system. There was no damage to the small work barge or the small work tug MISS ASHLEY.  Following the allision, the small work barge and the TANGIER SOUND ricocheted towards the eastern fender wall and the cutter head of the dredge collided with the upper deck of the MAVERICK resulting in approximately $18,000 in damage to the vessel. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, The Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision with the west fender wall as the vessel proceeded through the bridge, which negatively impacted the vessel\u2019s positioning between the fendering systems.

While transiting through the Dulac Pontoon Bridge, the wind set the starboard bow of the WHISKY STAR XIX onto the northwest fender system causing damages to the timbers and pilings of the fender system and minor damages to the WHISKY STAR XIX. The total reportable damages to the bridge totaled, $58,600, which does not meet the criteria for a Serious Marine Incident. \n\nThe causes of the allision were 1) a mismatch between the Master and the environment. The 15 kt winds pushed the tow into the bridge fendering system. 2) A planning error. The Master applied a general rule of thumb and transited through the bridge at 2.8 kts. The large size of the tow, wind speed and navigable width should have been factors for the Master to adjust speed or other factor of ship handling."}

The incident occurred as the vessel was preparing to transit under the bridge, the operator of the vessel lowered the outriggers in order to clear the air gap of the bridge. As the vessel was transiting through the fendering system, the operator did not realize that the vessel was getting too close to the west side fendering syatem when the cabling for the vessels rigging became entangled on the fendering system. The allision caused the trawl door to fell overboard. The vessel cleared the bridge and lowered the outriggers to recover\/reel in the trawl door. The trawl door was recovered and the vessel continued with its voyage without further incidents. There were no damages to the vessel and\/or the bridge\u2019s fendering system.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision with the fendering system which caused the vessel to get tangled up with the fendering system. The weather was not a contributing factor in this casualty. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty were: (1) the operator misjudged the distance of the vessel with the fendering system while transiting through the bridge, and (2) complacency, since the operator has transited through the same bridge\/fendering system many times in the past."}

The Relief Captain put the vessel on a similar track line as in the past to set up the tow and vessel to navigate through the main navigational span of the Huey P. Long Bridge, and was flanking the turn as he set up to transit the bridge.  The wind was gusting intermittently up to 50 knots from the east to the west.  One such gust caught the vessel and its tow and set the vessel sliding toward the Left Descending Bank of the river, and towards Pier II of the bridge. The Relief Captain attempted to steer out of the situation, and put the vessel hard to starboard, full ahead.  The sustained gust of wind kept setting the vessel to port, and the port string of barges struck the rubber fendering\/bumpering system of Pier II, causing damage both above and below the waterline. Repairs were effected at a cost of $12,947. Damage to the barge JKM 6410 in way of the #4 wing void, and on the bilge knuckle in way of the #3 and #4 wing voids estimated at $5,000.\n\nNote: Pier II was struck and damaged 1 time prior to this allision, on January 12, 2016, and once after on March 24, 2016. New Orleans Public Belt Railroad is responsible for the upkeep and repairs of the bridge, and was waiting for the high water conditions that have prevailed since early January to subside before making a full assessment of the damages and making repairs to the bridge, thus why damage was compounding on top of damage.  Though an initial assessment was made of the total bridge damages (dated March 11, 2016) and a total cost estimate was provided for the allisions occurring prior to the one on March 24, 2016, the final assessment was successfully made in May.  Each allisions\u2019 damage cost was itemized to show each incident cost as though repairs would have been affected totally separate from each other on each occasion.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating even for this casualty was the allision. Contributing factors to the allision included 1) the gusting wind conditions that set the CSS TEXAS sideways unexpectedly, 2) the Relief Captain underestimating the strength and sustainability of the gusting wind, and 3) the Relief Captain not leaving extra room to account for the unpredictability of the prevailing conditions.\n\nThis incident met the criteria for a reportable marine casualty & an Informal Investigation\/Data Collection was conducted."}

{"activity_id":5938700,"brief":"On June 18, 2016, the M\/V ARABELLA was in transit on the Corpus Christi Channel to Interstate Grain Dock in the inner harbor.  When the Pilot came onboard at anchor the vessel\u2019s air draft was discussed and it was determined the vessel had to take on ballast to get an adequate draft to pass under the Corpus Christi Harbor Bridge.  The Captain did not want to go to anchor so he instead chose to proceed inbound and take on ballast while in transit.  The Pilot agreed and the vessel was cleared for entry.  \n\nTo increase the vessel\u2019s draft, ballast was placed in the #3 aft peak tank.  Assist tugs standing by provided draft readings as the vessel approached the bridge and gave a final draft that seemed adequate for clearance.  While passing underneath the bridge, the vessel\u2019s INMARSAT antenna struck the span.  The antenna broke off of its pole and fell to the deck below.  The vessel maintained all navigational capabilities and proceeded to dock without any further issues.  There were no injuries, pollution, or other damage.  A technician was able to replace the antenna and restore all INMARSAT functions.  The bridge was not damaged.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the failure of the Captain to ensure adequate air draft with the known bridge height.  Prior to entering anchorage, the vessel had cleaned all cargo tanks in preparation of loading operations.  The Captain did not want to place ballast in a cargo tank and have to re-clean.  Instead, he chose to take on ballast in a limited time frame after the Pilot insisted.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:\n\n1) The Captain failed to adequately prepare his vessel for entry into port to account for all known situations.  The Captain did not use all available information to ensure safe passage.  Only until the Pilot insisted the vessel take on ballast did the Captain consider the proper air draft.\n\n2)  The Captain did not want to delay entry into port by staying at anchorage and take on adequate ballast for acceptable vessel draft.  Instead, he chose to take on ballast while in transit.  This reduced the ability of the assist tugs to provide accurate draft readings."}

The CRIMSON CLOVER was underway with the tugs THE DELTA (O.N. 586904), a 53.5' 1050HP uninspected towing vessel (UTV) which was pushing from astern and the JUDSON B, (O.N. 611533), a 56.6', 91GT, 800HP uninspected towing vessel, assisting from port bow of the CRIMSON CLOVER.\n\nThe CRIMSON CLOVER's last port of call was Domincan Republic and the vessel was towed on a registry voyage by the towing vessel ANN T. CHERAMIE. A Mobile Bay Bar Pilot navigated the ANN T. CHARAMIE and CRIMSON CLOVER into Mobile Bay to approximately the State Docks.\n\nOn 20AUG2016 at approximately 1500 local, the CRIMSON CLOVER was inbound Mobile Bay\/Mobile River near Arlington channel with Mobile Bay Bar Pilot on board.  UTV THE DELTA met the vessel at approximately Arlington Channel and attached to the stern of the CRIMSON CLOVER on the stern with a double wire pushing arrangment.  The JUDSON B picked up Harbor Pilot Bernie Scott and dropped him off on board the CRIMSON CLOVER, then disembarked the Bar Pilot off the ANN T. CHARAMIE and returned the Bar Pilot to the State Docks. When the towing arrangement was just south of the Cochrane Bridge on the Mobile River, the ANN T. CHARAMIE discontinued towing the CRIMSON CLOVER and proceeded to the port side of the CRIMSON CLOVER to disconnect from the tow.  At this time THE DELTA was on the stern of the CRIMSON CLOVER and the JUDSON B, had taken station on the starboard of the CRIMSON CLOVER.  As the vessel continued under the Cochrane Bridge, the pilot had taken station on the starboard bow of the CRIMSON TIDE and the JUDSON B had moved to the port beam of the barge with a cable attached.  The three vessels were communicating on VHF-67 with the pilot giving instruction to the JUDSON B and THE DELTA.  The master of THE DELTA stated that he had no forward visibility because of the barges high structure.  \n\nAs the vessel appoached the open CSX Chickasaw railroad swing bridge, the harbor pilot stated that he was lining up the 70' wide CRIMSON CLOVER to pass through the 135' opening with himself on the starboard bow of the CRIMSON CLOVER and the JUDSON B on the port beam with a wire over.  THE DELTA was pushing ahead from the rear of the CRIMSON CLOVER.  As the vessel came closer to the open bridge, the harbor pilot gave a command for the JUDSON B to pull to correct the heading to port.  The pilot of the JUDSON B stated that he pulled then disconnected because he was approaching the fendering system and needed to disconnect to avoid striking the southern fendering system.  When the JUDSON B pulled it caused the CRIMSON CLOVER heading to move rapidly toward the southern extention of the bridge.  The JUDSON B's pull also caused the starboard stern to swing toward the northern fender.  CRIMSON CLOVER's starboard aft beam struck the large northern fender on the eastern side of the bridge.  Immediatly the port bow struck the railroad bridge piling causing damage to the cement and railing system on the southern connection of the bridge. After striking the bridge, the harbor pilot, realligned the arrangement and proceeded up Chickasaw River to Crimson dock. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined the initiating event for the casualty to be the mis-communication\/working experience between the operator of the JUDSON B and the pilot on board the CRIMSON CLOVER. The pilot expected the master of the JUDSON B to pull the CRIMSON CLOVER to port then check\/stop the swing which the JUDSON B did not, just before passing in between the open bridge.  \n\nDrug testing was administered to the vessel operators. For unknown reasons the master of THE DELTA had a non-DOT test admininstered.  Recommended training be given to master for DOT compliance post casualty.  Coast Guard Investigators directed master of JUDSON B to have drug testing as well.  Testing for JUDSON B was beyond 32 hour requirement.   CRIMSON CLOVER sustained damage to port bow just above the water line.  Structural damage sustained."}
{"activity_id":5992674,"brief":"At approximately 1209 EST on Sept 3, 2016, the small passenger vessel LONGFELLOW BRIDGET was underway in the Charles River, MA, on a commercial sightseeing tour when it sustained a material failure to its main propeller shaft. The vessel lost propulsion and maneuverability and was towed back to the dock for repair.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the material failure of the propeller shaft where it sheared off in the vicinity of the set screw, which rendered the vessel unable to maneuver.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) three welds applied to the shaft and collar coupling to prevent shaft slippage were fractured, and (2) an installation flaw in the propeller shaft and coupling (in way of the welds and set screw) weakened the shaft, making it more prone to breaking."}
{"activity_id":5993480,"brief":"At approximately 1840 EDT on August 29, 2016 the commercial fishing vessel FLICKA allided with the Two Mile Bridge in Cape May, New Jersey. The FLICKA had just been purchased by a new owner and was being taken from Cape May, NJ to Anacortes, WA by a delivery captain and crew.\n\nThe FLICKA struck the bridge with its port bow causing moderate non-structural damage to the vessel's bulwarks in the port bow area. The deflection of the bulwarks caused the deck-to-hull joint to separate and create a 3' long x 6\" opening in the generator space approximately 20' above the waterline. The deck, hull plating, and associated structural members were also deflected in the immediate area of the impact. The only damage suffered by the bridge was concrete damage to a small house that contains some mechanical equipment. The structure of the bridge itself was unaffected. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the FLICKA alliding with the bridge. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:(1) the masters failure to follow the route recommended by the previous owner, (2) excess speed which left the bow thruster ineffective and (3) the master's unfamiliarity with the engine operating characteristics as the electronic engine controls failed to respond immediately, as anticipated by the master, to a full astern command."}

The pilot had switched ship propulsion control from the center bridge main engine control telegraph to the starboard bridge wing telegraph.  Upon arriving at the starboard wing telegraph the pilot ordered a slow astern bell with no response.  The pilot immediately dropped the port anchor for safety reasons to slow the ship due to another ship moored dead ahead and switched control of the ship back to the center bridge telegraph.  The pilot regained control of the propulsion plant and safely moored the ship to Oakland Berth 32.  The starboard bridge wing telegraph was electrically isolated and the ship's electrician investigated the cause of the failure. \n\nThe primary causal factor for this casualty, which resulted in the loss of propulsion event, was the telegraph handle not being placed in the proper \"stop\" position for transfer of bridge control resulting in \"follow up\" failure of the starboard bridge wing main engine control telegraph, the bridge crew's lack of training on the telegraphs alarms, and the steps required to clear them. Due to this reason the main engine could not be started from the starboard bridge wing telegraph."}

{"activity_id":6025828,"brief":"On 17 October 2016 at approximately 1440, the commercial fishing vessel H & R allided with the underside of the FM 1495 Bridge in Brazosport, TX.  The vessel was transiting inbound on the old Brazos River, enroute to the formerly known Western Seafood dock. The Master had not conducted this transit in approximately 17 years.  As the vessel made its way up the waterway, the 55ft outriggers were fully hoisted up. Additionally, there was a 6'9\" stabilizer extension installed at the end of the port outrigger.  The starboard stabilizer extension had previously detached from the starboard outrigger and was being store onboard the vessel.  Prior to reaching the FM 1495 bridge, the Master directed the two crewmembers onboard to lower the outriggers about 35 degrees in order to pass freely under the bridge; this was his normal practice from previous transits in the past.  He also declutched the main engine out of gear and allowed the vessel to drift towards the bridge at approximately 2 knots with the inbound flood current.  The Master observed the vessel begin to roll just before crossing under the bridge due to the wake of a nearby small recreational vessel.  \n\nWhen the H & R was transiting underneath the FM 1495 bridge, the port outrigger struck the underside of the bridge.  There was no apparent damage sustained on the bridge; however, the force of the allision caused the port stabilizer extension to break at the base weld on the outrigger.  Consequently, the extension fell off and became entangled in the lines overheard the vessel's deck.  It was later safely lowered to the deck by the crew.  The Master had no intentions to repair\/replace the stabilizer extension, since he did not feel it to be useful or necessary for fishing operations.  The vessel proceeded to the nearby dock without further incident."}

The MISS CATE was underway, making way southbound on the southern branch of the Elizabeth River pushing ahead the dredge VIRGINIAN enroute to Norfolk Dredge Dock in Chesapeake, VA.  The tow and dredge were approaching the Gilmerton Bridge when the Master misaligned the tow and dredge to transit between the Gilmerton Bridge's fendering system.  He incorrectly factored in the wind, current, width of bridge span, and dimensions of the dredge to safely transit through the span without an allision.  Once the Master anticipated an allision, he quickly took all three engines out of gear to reduce the impact.  The portside of the VIRGINIAN allided with the Gilmerton Bridge fendering system, but the tow, dredge, and bridge were not damaged as a result of the allision.  The Master notified the Coast Guard immediately following the marine casualty and although the incident did not reach the threshold for a Serious Marine Incident, he conducted post casualty alcohol and drug testing.   \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the inadequate vessel maneuvering of the MISS CATE to transit between the bridge fendering system, the subsequent event was the VIRGINIAN allision with the Gilmerton Bridge fendering system.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) execution error\/attention failure: mariner failed to take early and substantial action to avoid allision with the bridge fendering system by incorrectly factoring in the wind, current, width of bridge span, and dimensions of the dredge to safely transit through without an allision, (2) environmental complexity:  the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River has a bend on the north end of the Gilmerton Bridge. The natural bend in the river in conjunction with a narrow channel between the Gilmerton Bridge fendering system makes navigating this waterway complex and provides little room for navigational error for vessel's with larger breaths and widths, and (3) failure to use an assist tug:  other operators use an assist tug to aid with wide tows that transit through the Gilmerton Bridge but this vessel did not and could have prevented this allision.\n\nRecommend closing this incident investigation activity without a referral for enforcement."}

The allision did not cause damage to the bridge or the barges.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was pilot error."}
{"activity_id":6054410,"brief":"On December 4th, 2016, at approximately 0800, the vessel PAUL RUSS was underway southbound on the Hudson River when the vessel allided with the Castleton (Castleton-on-the-Hudson) Bridge. An all round white light struck the bridge, and was bent back at about a 45 degree angle. The damage was estimated to be around $500. The causal factors for the incident were inaccurate air draft calculations and incorrect ship particulars, all of which were provided to the pilot who was navigating the vessel at the time of the allision. No subsequent events occurred."}
{"activity_id":6054773,"brief":"At approximately 1912 EST on October 12, 2016, the cruise ship VIKING STAR was underway from Boston, MA to New York, NY with 1374 persons on board.  While transiting the Cape Cod Canal with a Federal Pilot on board, the aft mast of the VIKING STAR struck the Cape Cod Canal Railroad Bridge (under the lift span of the bridge).  As a result of the allision with the bridge, the aft top mast was broken and the aft masthead light was extinguished.  The Cape Cod Canal Railroad Bridge did not sustain any damage as a result of the allision. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the aft mast striking the railroad bridge lift span. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the pilot card for the VIKING STAR not indicating if the air draft condition is for masts up or masts down condition and (2) failure of the bridge team of the VIKING STAR to adhere to vessel rules as set forth in the Bridge Procedures Manual of the VIKING STAR, which mandates a safety margin for air draft clearance situations of at least 2 meters."}

After the bridge went up and stopped, the CURTIS REINAUER passed under the bridge and its mast struck the bottom of the bridge.  \n\nThe investigation revealed that the bridge was not up the whole way and the indication lights were inoperable.  Because the lights were inoperable, the Master of the CURTIS REINAUER had no way of realizing that the bridge was not up the whole way.  The USCG District 1 Bridges Branch investigated the incident as well with findings against the bridge operator. No damage to the bridge was reported and damage to the vessel was less than $25K. There were no injuries associated with this case."}

A case was opened initially with the thinking that the monetary amount for damage may possibly be over the $25K threshold but estimates put the damage at less than 25k, therefore this is not a reportable marine casualty under 46 CFR part 4."}
{"activity_id":6061952,"brief":"The tug SARA K was pushing loaded (octane) tank barge (T\/B) FMT 1062  near the I-10 bridge in the Houston Ship Channel, when the FMT 1062\u2019s vapor vertical pipe stack allided with the underside of the I-10 bridge. The allision resulted in minimal damage to the T\/B\u2019s vapor stack. No injuries or pollution were reported. \n\nThe tug SARA K was traveling outbound with only the loaded T\/B FMT 1062 under ahead tow. As the tug and barge made their way underneath the I-10 Bridge, the Master miscalculated the vertical clearance required to safely navigate the barge underneath the bridge. Specifically, the Master did not take into consideration the height of the vapor vertical pipe stack on the FMT 1062. As a result, the vent stack struck the underside of the I-10 Bridge. The stack bended forward approximately 15 degrees creating a distortion of the vapor stack\u2019s rain shield; there was no damage to the bridge. \n\nThis marine casualty was the result of the Master\u2019s inattention to details to include tide, currents, draft but specifically the vertical clearance required to safely navigate underneath the bridge."}

As the LIBERTY passed through the McArdle Street Bridge opening, the ship swung its rudder hard right and increased its power pushing the LIBERTY towards the North side of the opening.  The LIBERTY's starboard quarter fendering made light contact with the bridge fendering and slid along the bridge fendering for approximately 5 feet.  The master of LIBERTY assessed no damage to the LIBERTY or the bridge itself and notified his company of the situation, which then notified the Coast Guard.  \n\nThe Coast Guard instructed the company that this was a reportable marine casualty and to notify the bridge tender."}
{"activity_id":6077943,"brief":"At approximately 1030 CST on January 26, 2017 the UTV JOHN D NUGENT was heading south bound on the Illinois River in the vicinity of mile marker 254 (Seneca Bridge). The vessel was pushing six, open hopper barges loaded with corn in a 3 x 2 deep configuration. During the transit, the starboard stern of barge (PML 1327B) made contact with the bridge fender system. No damage to the bridge or barge was reported. The duty IO made contact with D8 Bridge Branch who confirmed there was no damage, as reported by CSX railroad.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was operator error. The configuration of the barges (rake barge on the port side and 2 box ends of the barges in the middle of the tow) made it difficult for the operator to control through this area of the river. The tow unexpectedly slid to starboard which resulted in the allision."}

Coast Guard Marine Safety Unit Morgan City received an email confirmation from the Bridge Management Specialist at the 8th Coast Guard District office confirming the damage assessement.\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event for this casualty was when the MR.DEVIN allided with the Bayou Beouf railroad bridge."}
{"activity_id":6081750,"brief":"On January 31, 2017, at approximately 14:30, the container ship HUMEN BRIDGE, IMO# 9302164, experienced a reduction in propulsion while enroute from Long Beach, CA to Oakland, CA.  The vessel encountered an RPM slowdown on their main diesel engine when operating above a dead slow ahead bell.  The vessel tested local, pilothouse and engine room control and experienced the same RPM slowdown.  The vessel was able to maintain steerage and a safe speed by operating at a dead slow ahead bell.\n\nUpon investigation by the crew it was determined that there was a loose cable connection between the circuit control unit and the ELVA\/FIVA hydraulic control system.  The engine was stopped to reconnect the loose wires and the system was reset.  The main diesel engine was restarted and found to be in normal operation."}

As the vessel made their approach on the Owensboro Highway Bridge (SR 2262) the first two barges in the starboard string C1099 & C1073, allided with the bridge pier near Ohio River mile 756, Owensboro, KY. The crew conducted a visual inspection and reported nine broken wires within the tow and a deck winch torn from the deck of the C139. \n\nThe Coast Guard's investigation found the initiating event was the allision and gusty winds contributed to the tow's allision with the bridge, as the 1800 horsepower towing vessel attempted to transited the bridge with the 12-empty barges."}
{"activity_id":6089079,"brief":"At approximately 1758 CST on February 13, 2017, the UTV DELTA LADY allided the West Larose Lift Bridge at MM 35.6, Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) in Larose, Louisiana.  A new crow's nest wheelhouse was just added to the top of the vessel by a shipyard in Lake Charles, Louisiana.  The allision occurred as the UTV DELTA LADY was underway light boat from Lake Charles heading to Belle Chasse, Louisiana for a job.\n\nThe vessel's newly installed crow's nest wheelhouse hit the bridge and fell into the ICW.  The bridge representative reported no damage.  However, the waterway was closed to all marine traffic for 7 hours until the vessel's crow's nest wheelhouse was recovered from the waterway.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event for this casualty was the bridge allision.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:  (1) The vessel's master forgot about the newly installed crow's nest wheelhouse.  (2) With the newly installed crow's nest wheel house, the UTV DELTA LADY\u2019s height was 49 feet.  (3) The West Larose Bridge height in the down position is 37 feet.  (4) In the raised position, the bridge\u2019s height is 72 feet.  (5) The vessel's captain simply did not ask the bridge tender to lift the bridge.\n\nBy 0100 on 14-Feb-2017, the UTV TAMPA BAY brought a crane barge on location and a diver was able to retrieve the crow's nest wheel house from the bottom of the ICW..  The UTV DELTA LADY was restricted to daytime transit only as the vessel\u2019s mast light was out.  The vessel proceeded to Belle Chasse for repair.  The crew was drug\/alco tested.  DIO and Port State\/UTV inspector obtained witness statements and attended vessel, checked credentials and the bridge remained operational."}
{"activity_id":6089179,"brief":"At approximately 0753 CST on February 12, 2017, the UTV PASS CHRISTIAN pushing ahead 2 red flagged barges had its mast and antennas damaged when the West Larose Bridge Tender lowered the lift bridge onto the vessel before the tow cleared the bridge opening.  DIO called the bridge operator and no clear explanation was given as to why the lift bridge was lowered before the tow cleared the bridge, except that it was a mistake or misunderstanding.  The bridge is located along the Inter Coastal Waterway at mile marker 35.6 west of the Harvey Locks.  It is a Louisiana state bridge operated by state employees.\n\nThe vessel's mast light near the Furuno Radar Scopes was impacted straight down from above by the lowering bridge.  The rear flag pole was bent by the lowing bridge.  \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the bridge operator lowing the bridge before the tow cleared the bridge span causing the bridge to hit the UTV PASS CHRISTIEN.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:  (1) The UTV PASS CHRISTIAN had an air space or height of 46.5 feet from the waterline to the very top of the highest antenna.  (2) The West Larose Lift Bridge height is 37 feet above the water's surface in the down position and in the raised position is 72 feet above the water's surface.  (3) The bridge was opened all the way when the tow was \u00bc mile from the bridge span.  (4) After both leading barges cleared the span, but just before the UTV PASS CHRISTIAN was immediately under the span, the bridge tinder lowered the bridge onto the UTV PASS CHRISTIAN causing the incident.  (5) As the vessel\u2019s wheelhouse was directly below the lowering bridge, from the master's view, the master could not tell that the bridge was lowering on him until he felt the first hit from above.  Then, he frantically called the bridge operator on channel 13 to open up.  \n\nHad the bridge operator started to lower the bridge 10 seconds earlier or if the tow was moving a \u00bc mile slower, the wheel house could have been impacted and this near miss casualty could have been a lot worse.  Two people were in the wheel house at time of impact.  Due to restricted overhead view from the wheelhouse, neither noticed the bridge lowering until the first impact.\n\nTo prevent a reoccurrence, it is suggested vessels designate lift bridge lookouts to notify the master immediately if the bridge is being mistakenly lowered on the wheel house."}
{"activity_id":6089757,"brief":"At approximately 0800 EST on January 13, 2017, the fishing vessel CAPT GARLAND allided with the north fender system of the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge in Oregon Inlet, NC. The allision occurred as the CAPT GARLAND was inbound from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pamlico Sound en route to offload shrimp at Hobo Seafood in Swan Quarter, NC.\n\nThe CAPT GARLAND struck the fender system with her bow sustaining minor damage (a broken wire stay in the rigging for the starboard outrigger and paint damage to the starboard hull). However, the fender system sustained damages to the vertical boards and horizontal walers which was estimated at $49,000. After the allision, the CAPT GARLAND continued with its voyage and shortly after CG Station Oregon Inlet boarding team conducted a safety boarding in the vicinity of the Old House Channel. The CAPT GARLAND had a current CFVS decal (No. 208405) expiring at the end of January 2017 and the boarding team found no discrepancies. The boarding officer also conducted a breathalyzer analysis on all 03 persons aboard the CAPT GARLAND;After the boarding, the CAPT GARLAND headed to homeport in Swan Quarter, NC.  \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the inability of the vessel to sufficiently respond to the operator's attempted turn to port, due to the direction and speed of the water current in Oregon Inlet. This was followed by the operator's failed attempt to maneuver the vessel away from the fender system and eventual allision with the north fender system. The casual factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the unpredictable current conditions of the Oregon Inlet, (2) narrow channel beneath the bridge, (3) the operator's decision to rely on poorly communicated radio recommendations, and (4) the vessel having one engine and shaft which could limit maneuverability."}
{"activity_id":6090278,"brief":"At approximately 0150 EST on February 15, 2017, the small passenger vessel SWIFT RUNNER allided with the Townsend Inlet bridge. The allision occurred as the vessel was transporting crew from Avalon Marine Center in Avalon, New Jersey to the dredge TEXAS off of Cape May.\n\nThe port side of the SWIFT RUNNER struck the North side of the bridge's fendering system. The bridge was inspected the following morning by the county bridge comission with no damage reported. The SWIFT RUNNER was attended by a Sector Delaware Bay Marine Inspector. The deck port side amidships had a minor kink. It was determined that the deck did not require immediate corrective action. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision with the Townsends Inlet bridge. The causal factor that contributed to this casualty include the masters failure to account for the current as he maneuvered through the Townsend Inlet bridge."}
{"activity_id":6092123,"brief":"At approximately 1830 CST on February 18th, 2017, the UTV ALBERT C allided with the Lemont Railroad Bridge at mile marker 300.6 on the Chicago Sanitary Ship Canal.  The ALBERT C was conducting fleeting operations at the time of the incident with one empty dry hopper barge (CBX 203).  The ALBERT C picked up the CBX 203 and was backing down in close proximity of the bridge.  While the Master of the ALBERT C was backing down, the vessel struck the railroad bridge causing damage to the port side, aft pilothouse of the ALBERT C as well as a small inset and paint scrapes on southside of the bridge.  The allision was unintended and as such, the incident was deemed a reportable marine casualty.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was operator error, during the maneuvering of the ALBERT C and tow as the vessel was backing down towards the Lemont Railroad Bridge.  This was followed by the ALBERT C alliding with the bridge.  \n\nAlthough this incident did not reach the threshold of an informal investigation, MSU Chicago upgraded the level of investigation based on facts discovered during the preliminary investigation.  These facts included that a licensed mariner failed to ensure the vessel wheelhouse was fully retracted before approaching a bridge and failed to maintain communication with the lookout. By upgrading the incident, MSU Chicago will be able to document causal analysis, draw conclusions about the incident to share with industry, and ultimately prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Further, this activity will be referred for enforcement."}
{"activity_id":6092315,"brief":"On February 18, 2017, at approximately 0500 local time, the Marshall Islands flagged cargo vessel SEA PROTEUS allided with the Union Pacifc Railroad Bridge as it was transiting inbound to Pittsburg Terminal #3, Suisun Bay, California. Calculations by both the master and pilot afforded the vessel a 4ft clearance between the vessel and the bridge. However, the vessel's INMARSAT Antenna was over 4ft higher than the vessel's schematic and was subsequently knocked down. No damage reported to the bridge.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, the U.S. Coast Guard determined that the initiating event leading up to the casualty was an inaccurate vessel schematic. This gave both the master and the pilot the false impression that the vessel had a 4ft air gap clearance."}
{"activity_id":6095556,"brief":"At approximately 1630 Eastern Standard Time (EST) on February 25, 2017, the towing vessel BRIDGET CAULLEY was pushing four empty red flagged barges in a 2x2 configuration down bound. As the vessel and tow approached the Cannelton Lock and Dam the lead starboard barge, HFL406, allided with the long wall while entering the lock at mile marker 720 on the Ohio River.  The HFL406's last cargo was styrene.  \n\nThe crew conducted a visual inspection of the tow and found only damage to the HFL406 barge, no injury or pollution. The barge had a smooth inset on the outer vertical shell plate and rub bar of the #1 starboard void. The inset was approximately 8 feet long, beginning at the deck level extending down approximately 12 feet with a 3 inch inset. At approximately 2149 EST the Kirby dispatch notified the Coast Guard of the marine casualty.\n\nThe Coast Guard's investigation found the initiating event was a navigation error while operating in 25 mph winds.  The Pilot got the head of the tow into the lock but could not align the stern. The Pilot tried to back down the barges to avoid the allison but failed. The wind combined with the execution error contributed to the allison of the HFL406 barge with the lock wall as the BRIDGET CAULLEY proceeded to push her tow into the Cannelton Lock and Dam."}
{"activity_id":6100398,"brief":"On March 04, 2017, at approximately 0825, the Panamanian flagged container ship BAI CHAY BRIDGE had a degradation in propulsion while maneuvering to its berth approximately 750ft southwest of Yerba Buena Lighthouse in San Francisco Bay, California.  The pilot ordered a slow and then half ahead bell but did not get an engine response for either command.  The engineers received an alarm for the #6 cylinder for the main diesel engine that triggers an automatic slow down.  The engineers reset the alarm which enabled the engine to answer the pilot's engine order.  Afterwards, the vessel was able to safely manuever to its berth in the Port of Oakland without incident.\n\nUpon investigation, the U.S. Coast Guard determined the initiating event for the marine casualty was the failure of the injection control unit (ICU) for the #6 cylinder on the main diesel engine.  A subsequent event was the loss of propulsion.  The primary causal factor identified was the faulty condition of the injection control unit.  The defective ICU was eventually replaced, thereby rectifying the propulsion issues."}

The FEDERAL COLUMBIA struck the Delair Railroad Bridge\u2019s fenders on its port side, near holds 3 and 4, with minor damage sustained to the bridge and vessel.  The FEDERAL COLUMBIA\u2019s allision occurred as the vessel was transiting outbound of the Delaware River enroute to sea. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was an evasive vessel maneuver, releasing of the starboard anchor to prevent the FEDERAL COLUMBIA from grounding or alliding with the Delair Railroad Bridge.  This was followed by the eventual allision with the Delair Railroad Bridge\u2019s fendering system.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) lack of reference materials or policies for the bridge tender, (2) poor communications between the pilot and bridge tender, (3) the pilot\u2019s decision to proceed toward the bridge without establishing a proper signal, (4) the bridge tender\u2019s lack of monitoring the radio, and (5) the pilot\u2019s inability to adhere to 33 CFR 117.5."}
{"activity_id":6104107,"brief":"On March 11, 2017, at approximately 09:21L the tow vessel STEVE PLUMMER departed from mile 184 (Upper Dundee Loaded Fleet) with a single string of 03 loaded sand barges in tow; HMT 301, H418B, and HMT 316.  The tow vessel was transiting up bound on the Cumberland River from 184 to 192.5 (Hollywood Fleet) to drop the loaded sand barges.  The STEVE PLUMMER was attempting to pass through the CSX bridge span closest to the right descending bank and center span.  The operator onboard noted the tow was being set into the CSX guard pier located on the upstream side of the bridge.  The guard pier was located approximately 134 feet up river from the main span.  The operator of then commenced collision avoidance maneuvers by jockeying the throttles and rudders.  At approximately 11:20L, the H418B, the second barge in the tow H418B, struck the upper guard pier and dislodged at least 3 stones which landed in the water and on the deck.  Moments later the third barge in the tow, HMT 316, struck the guard pier near its port stern void, causing it to collapse towards the center of the channel.  The tug and tow passed through the bridge, but due to the allision and collision avoidance maneuvering, an immense amount of strain was placed on the tow lines and all the lines parted.  The barges drifted with the current and laid against the upstream side of the bridge.  The allision caused the number 5 starboard void to the barge H418B be set in as much as 10 inches and the entire cargo combing above the number 5 starboard to be set-in approximately 12 inches.  The barge HMT 316 experienced a 3 feet by 5 feet hole in the side plating.  The estimated damage amount for the bridge guard pier and the barges was approximately $1.7 million dollars.\n\nThis investigation involving the allision between the tow of the STEVE PLUMMER and the CSX Railroad Bridge, which ultimately resulted in the collapse of the upstream guard pier and damage to two barges on March 11, 2017, was determined to be a Major Marine Casualty as defined in Title 46, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 4.  As a result, this investigation was jointly investigation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTS).  The rules that governed the fact-finding portion of the investigation was conducted in accordance with 46 CFR Part 4.  The NTSB completed their analysis and conclusions and issued a Marine Accident Brief.\n\nThe Coast Guard investigation activity identified causal factors; non-existent or complacent company policy guidance to vessel operators and limited manueverability of the towing vessel at the time of the allision, due to the prevailing waterway conditons. A single referral was made for further investigation in accordance with 46 CFR Part 5 for possible enforcement action(s)."}

{"activity_id":6108049,"brief":"At approximately 0100 EST on March 10, 2017, the freight barge MSJ 111 allided with the fender system of the William B. Umstead Bridge while being pushed ahead by the towing vessel EVELYN DORIS. The allision occurred as the tow was transiting northbound in the Croatan Sound en route to Norfolk, VA. At the time of the allision, the MSJ 111 was empty. \n\nInitially, the starboard side of the MSJ 111 allided broadside with the eastern bridge fender which caused no damage to the vessel or the bridge. The spring-like force of the initial impact, however, pushed the MSJ 111 in the opposite direction causing the barge's port bow to allide with the northwest portion of the fender system. The MSJ 111 was undamaged. The northwest fender system of the bridge sustained significant damage. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of the MSJ 111 with the eastern fender of the William B. Umstead Bridge, which pushed the tow toward the opposite fender. This was followed by a second allision of the MSJ 111 with the northwest portion of the fender, resulting in significant damage to the structure. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the southwest winds which pushed the tow out of alignment while passing through the bridge, (2) the failure of the vessel operator to properly account for the force of the wind while passing through the bridge, and (3) the experience level of the vessel operator working in the Mate position."}

As a result, the vessel sustained damage to the VHF antenna's, mast head light and the radar scanner. The pilot onboard was a trip pilot and had only been on the vessel for two weeks.  He was unfamiliar with the vessel characteristics including her air draft.  The Ohio River at Cairo, IL was in moderate flood stage with a gauge reading of 52.12 ft at 2300, and had been in flood stage for several days. The pilot stated he thought he could clear the bridge as there were no marks indicating the heighth of the channel span. After striking the bridge while transitting underneath, the pilot did not report the allision to the company or the Coast Guard.  The following morning, the engineer onboard submitted a damage report to the vessel's port captain listing the damage to the vessel and requesting repairs. The port captain immediately emailed the vessel requesting to know the source of the damage, since he had not received any reports that the vessel had been in an incident and sustained damage. After confirming the bridge allision with the pilot, the port captain notified the Coast Guard of the incident.\n\nCopast Guard investigation determined the initiating event was the top of the towing vessel BIG J.O. alliding with the bottom of the span of the IC railroad bridge. Contributing factors include 1) Pilot's lack of knowledge of operating area; 2) Pilot's lack of awareness of the airdraft of his vessel; 3) Pilot's lack of wareness of the bridge clearance height at the current gage water levels; 4) Higher water levels on the Ohio river ar Cairo"}

At the time of the event the vessel was transiting from Cantonment, FL to Port Arthur, TX, with an empty chemical barge. They were headed west and preparing to pass under the Pensacola Bay Bridge. The winds were out of the south at 20-25 mph, and began pushing and setting the stern of the vessel northward, which was turning the bow of the barge into the dolphin to the south of it. The operator tried to avoid the allision by turning the rudder to starboard and picking up the port engine from 900 rpms to 1200 rpms. When he realized he was not going to make the turn in time, he started backing the engine down, but could not avoid the allision.

TERRAL (Official Number (O.N.) 1129737, operated by Terral River Service) was underway southbound on the Atchafalaya River pushing 6 (2 wide, by 3 long) open hopper barges loaded with aggregate. At approximately 1340 hours, the Captain of the MARGUERITE L. TERRAL contacted the Krotz Springs Railroad Bridge via phone to request a 1420 hours bridge opening. The bridge operator stated that they might be having a crew change at that time, but that the bridge would be opened for their transit. The bridge tender began a visual inspection of the rail and bridge. While on the bridge, he was met by two Union Pacific supervisors who had arrived unannounced to conduct an observation and performance assessment of the bridge tender. The bridge tender informed the supervisors, both of whom were accompanying him during the visual inspection, of the request for a swingspan opening that he received from a downbound vessel.  \n\nAt approximately 1416 hours, as the pilot was maneuvering the MARGUERITE L. TERRAL around an area of the river known as the \u201c39-mile bend,\u201d he acquired a line of sight on both the Krotz Springs Highway Bridges and the still closed railroad bridge less than two miles downriver. At 1417, the pilot attempted to contact the bridge tender twice using the vessel\u2019s VHF radio, but both radio callouts went unanswered. He then attempted to contact the bridge using the vessel\u2019s cellular phone. While the phone was ringing, he received a response via VHF radio from the bridge tender hailing \u201csouthbound boat at the 39.\u201d The bridge tender, who had still been performing the pre-opening examination of the bridge, had hailed the vessel after visually observing the MARGUERITE L. TERRAL and its tow rounding the bend.\n\nAs the pilot slowed the tow to allow the bridge to open, the MARGUERITE L. TERRAL was gradually set to west side of the river by the current on the stern. As a result, the MARGUERITE L. TERRAL was misaligned for a transit through the railroad bridge. \n\nWhen the swingspan was opened approximately three quarters of the way and rotating, the pilot put both main diesel engine throttles to full ahead in an attempt to pass through the opening and overcome the westerly set of the river current. This action, which resulted in some increase in the speed and greater control over the vessel, allowed him to clear the bow of the lead barge on the starboard side of the tow, RM 3367, between the swingspan pedestal and the easternmost pillar supporting the fixed portion of the bridge extending from the right descending bank. The pilot also lowered the retractable wheelhouse from its fully raised position to an undetermined distance, but not as far down to its lowest height, in an effort to protect its hydraulic pistons from potential damage. The lead barges cleared the turnstile but the middle barge in the starboard string (RM 3304B) made contact with the west piling. The vessel was making approximately 6-7 mph at the time of impact causing the coupling to break and setting the two lead barges (FR I640 and RM 3367) in the tow free. The pilot hailed the nearby towing vessel CHARLIE C rounded up the barges without further incident. \n\t\nThe impact caused failure of the connecting wires for both the RM 3367 and the lead barge on the port side of the tow, FR 1640; subsequently, both barges began to drift downriver. Although some of the other wires connecting the remaining four barges either loosened or failed, the barges remained linked together and connected to the MARGUERITE L. TERRAL. Crewmembers on three nearby towing vessels\u2014TONY LIPPMAN, RYAN, and CHARLIE C\u2014overheard VHF-radio communications following the allision and responded by assisting with regaining control of the two drifting barges.\n\nThe force of the impact also caused the pillar supporting the western portion of the fixed-bridge structure to shift horizontally. Multiple large-diameter positioning pins and bolts attaching the northern and southern truss-mounting plates to the caisson were sheered. The fixed portion of the bridge truss on the western side shifted horizontally as well, causing a misalignment of the lift rail with the fixed and rider rails. The total damage resulting from the allision exceeded $4 million.\n\nThrough its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the cause of the casualty to be the failure of the Krotz Springs Railroad Bridge to open promptly and fully upon being signaled by the MARGUERITE L. TERRAL as required by Title 33 USC \u00a7 499 (b)."}

The incident occurred as the SEA MINER approached the Morehead City High Rise Bridge with the main engine at idle speed (3 knot current pushing vessel towards the bridge) when the captain ordered the crewmembers to lower the outriggers in order to go underneath the bridge (approximately 65 feet clearance). The vessel's outriggers are deployed by an individual hydraulic winch for each outrigger. One of the crewmembers lowered the port outrigger without any problems, however the starboard outrigger did not lower because the cable jammed in the hydraulic winch system. When the crewmember realized that the starboard winch malfunctioned and was going to inform the captain, the starboard outrigger struck the center span of the bridge. The starboard outrigger was bent and the vessel continued through the Morehead City High Rise Bridge and proceeded to Oriental, NC in order to conduct an assessment. The vessel successfully moored at Garland Fulcher Seafood located in Oriental, NC. NC DOT was notified about the incident; no damages to the bridge. No injuries or pollution occurred as a result of the marine casualty.  \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the malfunction of the starboard winch system which prevented the deployment of the starboard outrigger causing the eventual allision between the SEA MINER and the Morehead City High Rise Bridge. The casual factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) outrigger cable jammed in the starboard hydraulic winch, (2) rising tide and current, and (3) restricted maneuverability."}
{"activity_id":6200968,"brief":"On July 6, 2017, the Coast Guard received a report from an officer from the Hampton Police Department regarding damage to the J.P. Mugler Bridge. The bridge is located on Mellen Street in the city of Hampton, Virginia. The reporting officer also noted that the Commercial Fishing Vessel (CFV) FRANK & MARIA (O.N. 587137), which was moored at the Wanchese Fish Company dock, had sustained damage to the bow area indicative of a possible allision with the damaged bridge. A Coast Guard Investigating Officer responded to the scene and determined through interviews with Wanchese Fish Company personnel that the CFV FANK & MARIA had allided with the bridge on June 22, 2017. \n\nAn assessment of damage to the J.P Mugler Bridge was conducted by Johnson, Miriman & Thompson Inc. The total damage assessment to the bridge as a result of the allision was $224,000. The vessel sustained non-structural damage to the bow.  No fiscal damage was reported by the marine employer of the FRANK & MARIA. However, the scheduled fishing trip that the vessel was preparing for was cancelled. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined the initiating event was the failing of the linkage that connected the throttle control cable to the reduction gear clutch control. Subsequent events were the loss of propulsion and allision with the bridge.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the lack of regulatory oversight regarding mandatory inspections by the Coast Guard, (2) regulatory operation requirements of a safety management system and pre-underway checks, (3) an execution error in action that could have identified the latent unsafe condition, and (4) regulatory baseline training that would be required if mariners were to obtain a merchant mariner credential.  \n\nIn addition, three alleged violations of law or regulations were identified:  (1) the Marine employers failed to immediately report and (2) failure to submit a written report within the timelines required by federal regulations. (3) property damage assessment was in excess of $100K and this marine casualty was determined to be a Serious Marine Incident (SMI). In accordance with federal regulation mandatory chemical testing by the marine employer is required for all SMIs, which the marine employer failed to carry out.\n\n \nRecommend closing this incident investigation activity with a referral to an enforcement activity."}

During the approach approximately 500' above the bridge, the tow began to slide toward the left descending bank.  The master increased propulsion and twisted the stern attempting to avoid the pier.  The master failed to prevent the allision from occurring but cleared the bridge through the left descending fixed span of the bridge.  \n\nDamage assessment of the bridge was conducted noting only cosmetic scraping.  Damage assessment of the barge was conducted by the crew revealing only cosmetic scraping.  No repairs were deemed necessary for the bridge or the barge.  USCG Aux and local FD verified report and provided photographic evidence.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the allision was due to the navigation of the master.  The master set up for passage through the LDB fixed span. After determining allision was imminent, he elected to increase speed and twist his stern around the pier unsuccessfully.  Weather and flow rates indicated normal operating conditions for navigation and were not deemed causal factors of the marine casualty.\n\nDuring this investigation, discussion with industry representatives revealed that towing vessels often deviate the charted sail line toward the left descending fixed span of this particular bridge due to the wider span than the left and right center spans (118').  The IO intends to communicate this deviation from the normally anticipated vessel traffic scheme to the USACE-Nashville for planning purposes."}

The allision occurred as the EVELYN DORIS was pushing ahead a deck barge loaded with concrete bridge pilings southbound in the Croatan Sound. The William B. Umstead Bridge is a fixed bridge spanning the Croatan Sound, between Manns Harbor and Roanoke Island, in NC and has a horizontal clearance of 80 feet. Since the deck barge had a width of approximately 65 feet, the Mate utilized his deckhand to assist as a lookout during the transit. Neither the Mate nor the deckhand paid attention to the mast of the tug and the EVELYN DORIS struck the center span of the bridge with its mast which broke off at the point of impact approximately three feet from the top. In addition to the broken mast, the vessel's mast head light was damaged. The bridge sustained only minor damage, also losing a navigational light. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of the EVELYN DORIS with the William B. Umstead Bridge while passing under the structure. The weather conditions were not a contributing factor in this casualty. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the Mate's lack of familiarity with the vertical clearance of the William B.

The vessels began transiting down the Cuyahoga River, destined for the Confined Disposal Facility located inside the East Basin of Cleveland Inner Harbor.  At approximately 11:55 p.m. the captain on the THOMAS R MORRISH contacted the Columbus Road Bridge tender and requested an opening. After the bridge was opened, the captain began maneuvering through the bridge while following the bend of the river to starboard. As he attempted to turn under the bridge, the bow of the barge stopped swinging to starboard and struck the west fender of the Union Terminal Viaduct (immediately down river of the Columbus Road Bridge) and the vessels came to a stop. The captain was able to back the vessels out of the damaged fender and continued through the turn. However, as the towing vessel stern swung to port, the port quarter of the towing vessel struck the west fender of the Columbus Road Bridge but did not cause any damage. The captain continued down the river and did not notify the Coast Guard. Due to the length of time from date of the allision to the time this investigation was completed (16 months), enforcement action was not taken for failure to report a marine casualty.\n\nThe USCG was notified of the damage to the Union Terminal Viaduct fender by the Regional Transit Authority (bridge owner) at approximately 8:00 a.m. the same morning. Security camera footage from the Columbus Street Bridge, combined with the bridge tender log book, was used to identify the THOMAS R MORRISH and barge CT 252 as the vessels that struck and damaged the fender.\n\nAlthough the initial estimate for fender repair was only $50,000.00, an updated cost estimate was submitted by the bridge owner a year after the incident that increased the cost to $447,000.00. Since the initial estimate was well under the Serious Marine Incident threshold of $100,000.00, alcohol and drug testing was not conducted on the captain of the towing vessel.\n \nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the barge and the Union Terminal Viaduct fender. After the captain backed the vessels out of the fender, the port quarter of the towing vessel allided with the Columbus Road Bridge fender. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) limited vessel maneuverability, (2) dynamic river current, (3) failure to anticipate effects of current, and (4) inexperience with maneuvering scenario."}

The overall size of the tow was 282 ft. x 48.5 ft. with a charted bridge horizontal clearance of 50 ft. As the vessel approached the bridge opening, it made contact, leading to damage of the wooden structures, concrete foundations and pilings with an estimated monetary damage of approximately $10,000 to $17,000.  \n\nIt was discovered that as the vessel approached the bridge opening, there was under 2 ft. of clearance. The master pushed up against the north (starboard fender) and made its way through the opening assuming no damage was incurred. Following the allision, the master made a report to Coast Guard Sector Miami via VHF, but due to miscommunication, the incorrect bridge was recorded (New River CSX Railway Bridge in Ft. Lauderdale, FL), and thereby Marine Safety Detachment Lake Worth was not notified of the casualty. The master reported no visible damage to none of the vessels or the bridge. \n\nThe Coast Guard investigation has determined that the initiating event that led to the casualty was the vessel maneuvering with regards to the speed it was approaching the bridge, followed by the allision. The causal factors were 1) the current, 2) the bridge clearance, 3) the beam of the barges, 4) the vessel speed, and 5) the lack of control of the barges with regards to making a controlled approach. \n\nInitially as there was conflicting data between the monetary estimates regarding bridge damage due to pre-existing damage, it was relayed that damage could potentially be above $25,000, which is why the investigation was initially classified as an Informal Investigation, although based on the estimate, it meets the level of a Data Collection.

Both allisions occurred nearly simultaneously as the UTV DORELLA BANTA was underway west bound along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway approaching MM 59.5 west of the Harvey Lock.  The tow initially got underway from Star Fleet, MM 90 along the Lower Mississippi River heading to Boones Fleet in Houston.  \n\nThe bridge fender system and the underside of the lift bridge were allided, but no damage reported and the bridge remained operational.  The mast head light of the UTV DORELLA BANTA was damaged and the port stern of red flag barge CCL 410 suffered a 14 foot long by 5 foot wide inset that began at the barge's deck.  All damage was above the waterline.  A Marine Surveyor and Coast Guard Inspector determined repairs to barge CCL 410 are deferred until next Internal Structural Examination due September 4, 2019.  A CG-835 was issued to that effect.  The UTV DORELLA BANTA was restricted to daylight transit only until the mast head light was repaired.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event was barge CCL 410 alliding the port side bridge fender system and the mast head light of the UTV DORELLA BANTA alliding the underside of the lift bridge nearly simultaneously.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: 1) Master neglected to request bridge be raised from 50 feet to accommodate for the vessel's 50 foot height; 2) Master's tow slid while lining up tow to go through the center of the 125 foot wide bridge opening causing port stern of barge CCL 410 to allide bridge fender."}

{"activity_id":6289280,"brief":"On June 4, 2017, at 10:23 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, the 625 foot U.S. freight vessel GREAT REPUBLIC entered the main channel of the Cuyahoga River and began transiting up the river. The Cuyahoga River had an outbound current of approximately 1.4 mph during the transit. As the vessel commenced turning through the starboard bend at Jacobs Pavilion, the current slowed the turn rate of the vessel\u2019s bow. At approximately 10:50 a.m., the port bow of the GREAT REPUBLIC allided with a concrete abutment\/fender for the CSX RR Bridge located at mile marker 1.28 on the east bank of the Cuyahoga River.  After the allision, the vessel safely proceeded to Osborne Concrete and Stone Dock. While completing the transit, the forepeak bilge high level alarm sounded, caused by water ingress through a hull puncture below the waterline. Once safely docked, the captain notified the Coast Guard and the vessel was unloaded and ballasted to bring the damage out of water to stop the flooding. \n\nThe vessel was authorized by Class (ABS) and the U.S. Coast Guard to complete a temporary patch to transit to Toledo, Ohio to complete permanent repairs. \n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the GREAT REPUBLIC and the CSX RR Bridge (1.28). After the allision, the steel hull failed below the waterline and the forepeak tank began to flood. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) strong river current, (2) failure to anticipate effects of current, (3) inadequate bridge fender, and (4) failure of hull below waterline."}
{"activity_id":6290428,"brief":"On 17 October 2017, the deck barge AB 114 (O.N. 1266931) was anchored outside of Chesapeake Yachts in Chesapeake, Virginia. The crew of the tug MR CHESTER (O.N. 642927) made fast to starboard side of the barge in a hip tow configuration, and then proceeded to move the barge north towards the I-64 High Rise Bridge on the Elizabeth River. At the same time, a spud barge was stationed on the east side of the fendering system underneath the I-64 High Rise Bridge conducting annual maintenance to the bridge. A Coast Guard Safety Broadcast Notice to Mariners (BNM) and a Marine Safety Information Bulletin (MSIB) were in place from Sector Hampton Roads informing local mariners that the bridge was under construction and anyone passing through the center channel was required to contact the work barge at least 15 minutes prior to transiting under the bridge. The Master of the MR CHESTER had transited in that area several times while the bridge was under maintenance and was aware of the requirements established in the BNM and MSIB. When the MR CHESTER and AB 114 began to approach the I-64 High Rise Bridge, the Captain made no attempt to contact the work crew to inform them of his intentions. As the MR CHESTER and AB 114 passed underneath the bridge, the AB 114 allided with the west side of the bridge fendering system.\n\nAfter alliding with the fendering system, the MR CHESTER and AB 114 continued northbound on the Elizabeth River and failed to report the allision. The crew on the work barge alerted Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), who notified Sector Hampton Roads of the allision. As a result of the allision with the fender system, four planks were knocked off the fender system and additional structural damage occurred to the support system. The damage amount to the fender system was estimated at $60,000.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event was the AB 114 allision with the west side of the I-64 High Rise Bridge fender system. The subsequent event was damage to the fendering system planks and structural supports. The causal factors contributing to the reportable marine casualty were: 1) overconfidence of the Captain created by multiple transits through the narrow channel without incident, 2) failure to notify the work barge before his transit as required by the BNM and MSIB, and 3) failure of VDOT to conduct repairs to the west side fender system prior to the allision.\n\nRecommend closing this preliminary investigation with a referral to an enforcement activity."}
{"activity_id":6290543,"brief":"MSD Quad Cities received a report of an allision between UTV PRAIRIE DAWN and the Clinton Railroad Bridge. The vessel was southbound pushing 6 barges (5 loaded grain, 1 empty). The set of approach was miscalculated and the barge ART 340 rubbed the bridge at MM 518. This caused damage to the barge in the #1 and #2 voids. Temporary repairs were made using shingling and tarps. Permanent repairs will be made in New Orleans.  The company is estimated approximately $1,000.00 in damage to the barge.\n\nAs a result of the investigation the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for the marine casualty was operator error and inexperience. There was a steersman that was working towards his license on watch behind the wheel with the master of the vessel. The set that was made to account for current while transiting under the bridge was the set that would normally work correctly for a tow of 15 barges. Due to the tow only having 6 barges, the set was not correct to prevent alliding with the bridge."}

The bridge was able to open to let a tug come through and retrieve the barge but shut down until a bridge inspector arrived and deemed it safe for trains to pass.  The bridge was shut down for about two hours and then resumed operations.  The barge was secured back to its mooring location with no damage.  A damage survey was conducted on the barge on October 23, 2017, and showed the barge did not sustain any damage.  This event did not result in any injuries or pollution.\n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard had determined that the initiating event was caused by securing the spuds on the barge so they could not free fall. This was followed by a passing storm that provided high winds, rain, and a rise in the river which contributed to the barge drifting into the channel with no means on stopping until it allided with the Railroad Bridge.  As result of this incident, the company that owns the barge has a new policy that requires the spud safety cables have slack faked out on deck to allow the spuds to free fall while moored in case the water level rises again the spuds can drop to secure the barge in place."}

The Pilot was making the approach to the Pigs Eye Bridge and was advised to stay to the red buoy side of the channel. The Pilot was unable to execute the turn correctly which resulted in the stern of the towing vessel being too far to the right descending bank(RDB). The swift current in the bend on the RDB was faster moving than the head of the tow near the left descending bank. This caused the tow to become crossways in the channel and the Pilot added speed to increase the turn rate on the head of the tow. This maneuver was partially successful but the port lead barge contacted the east pier of the swing bridge causing extensive damage. The ITASCA and WHITE ROCK assisted with the recovery of the port string of barges. The lead barge ART 35157 (loaded with soybeans) sustained damage and was taking on water in the bow rake. ART 35157 was later moored at a nearby fleeting area. \n\nThe bridge tender reported that the bridge pier was cracked along the length of the pier with significant damage. As a result of the allision, no railroad traffic was permitted to pass. The waterway remained open to river traffic, but only along the right descending bank span with one vessel and tow at a time. Initial property estimates placed this incident well over $500K making this a Major Marine Casualty necessitating notification to CG-INV and the NTSB. Additionally, Sector Upper Mississippi River has been in close coordination with the D8 bridge branch regarding the damage to the bridge and overseeing subsequent repairs. Investigating Officers drove to the bridge and walked out to the end of the bridge. The concrete pier supporting the end of the fixed part of the bridge on the east side of the river was displaced by approximately 4 to 5 feet to the down stream side.

According to the Master, the UTV BRITTANY BEYEL had suffered an engine casualty causing the tug to lose propulsion and drift on to the east side of the bridge causing damage to the hanging light and fenders.  After conducting an initial assessment, the master reported that the MIAMI SCIENCE BARGE did not suffer any damage itself, only damage was to material found on deck. The bridge operator reported that they were having an inspector assess the situation and that only one span of the bridge was able to open due to mechanical issues, prior to this incident.\n\nThe attending marine inspector was able to conduct an operational inspection of the UTV BRITTANY BEYEL main engine along with the damage survey and they were found to be consistent with the initial report.  The Master described that the engine casualty was likely caused by sediment or water build up in the air line for the 2 and 1 valve that allows the vessel to go in and out of gear and to throttle up and down. This issue caused the valve to get stuck and was the initiating event in the allision. The engineer was able to respond soon after the machinery failure and manually recycled the valve, turned the engine back on and it worked satisfactorily. By the time the Master regained control it was too late to avoid the allision, specially accounting for the open space with the only one span opening.\n\nThe damages associated with this allision was limited to the solar panel and aluminum A-frame on the MIAMI SCIENCE BARGE, estimated at $2,500. Also, a damage assessment was conducted by the Boca Raton Police and bridge crew of the PALMETTO PARK BRIDGE.  Those damages were deemed minimal and estimated at $6,000.  \n\nAs a result of the investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the loss of air control to the port engine while under load.  This undoubtedly had an effect on the vessel's maneuverability while in tow of the MIAMI SCIENCE BARGE.  This was followed by the eventual allision with the PALMETTO PARK BRIDGE.  The casual factor that contributed to the casualty was the limitation for both spans to open on the PALMETTO PARK BRIDGE."}

The UTV was pushing 12 dry cargo barges on the Mississippi River northbound at MM 583.4 while transiting under the bridge. The pilot's approach was favoring the red buoy line more than usual. The pilot had just made a turn prior to making his set to the bridge causing the set to be wider than usual. The pilot attempted to correct his course when he realized he was too close to the red buoy line. As a result of starting the set late the pilot was unable to avoid an allision with the bridge. This resulted in a barge break away splitting the barges into groups of 9, 2, and 1. The group of 9 laid over to the right descending bank and came to rest on the bridge. The 2 barges remained partially attached to the UTV. The 1 barge floated down the river and was recovered first. With the assistance of 2 assist vessels, the UTV managed to recover all 12 barges. It was later discovered that one of the 2 barges that remained partially attached to the UTV had struck the UTV puncturing 2 holes into the number 2 fuel tank and the number 3 gunnel. The 2 holes in the fuel tank and gunnel were located on the deck and the fuel level was well below the bottom of the hole.

There were 7 crew members on the tug TIMOTHY L REINAUER and 8 crew members on the JOAN MORAN. No injuries were reported on either vessel. No pollution was reported. Post-casualty drug and alcohol tests were conducted for the TIMOTHY L REINAUER and JOAN MORAN on crew members determined to be directly involved in the incident.\n\nThe JOAN MORAN was towing the light coal barge BRIDGEPORT astern on a 915-foot cable, transiting Long Island Sound from Bridgeport, CT enroute to Providence RI. The TIMOTHY L REINAUER pushing (in the notch) the RTC 84 was transiting Long Island Sound from New York, enroute to New Haven, CT. The JOAN MORAN\/BRIDGEPORT came upon the TIMOTHY L REINAUER\/RTC 84 near Stratford Shoal\/Middle Ground, off Stratford, CT, approaching from behind, creating an overtaking situation. The Mate on the JOAN MORAN requested a \"2 whistle pass\", which the Mate on the TIMOTHY L REINAUER agreed to.

The Mate on the JOAN MORAN turned hard to port and the Mate on the TIMOTHY L REINAUER went full astern but the collision could not be avoided. At 1735, the stern starboard quarter of the BRIDGEPORT made contact with the port bow of the RTC 84.  Both barges sustained damage. The RTC 84 suffered an inset on the port side bow in the way of the forepeak to frame #12 on the #1 port side ballast tank. All damage was above the waterline with no hull penetrations. The BRIDGEPORT suffered a 4-foot by 6-inch penetrating gash on the starboard aft quarter located 6 feet above the waterline. The collision occurred approximately 12 minutes from the agreed 2 whistle passing. \n\nThe cause of this casualty was determined to be the loss of situational awareness by the Mates of the JOAN MORAN and TIMOTHY L REINAUER. The Mate on the JOAN MORAN did not observe the course change of the TIMOTHY L REINAUER and reduced distance to pass. The Mate on TIMOTHY L REINAUR was occupied with putting the fix on a chart and switching charts that he did not maintain awareness of JOAN MORAN\/BRIDEPORT and the reduced passing distance."}

The allision occurred as the OCEANA was transiting the Corpus Christi Ship Channel entering the Corpus Christi Inner Harbor to load cargo.  At the time of the allision, the vessel was empty, \u201cin ballast\u201d and had departed the Aransas Fairway Anchorage earlier that morning.\n\nThe OCEANA struck the bridge with its INMARSAT C antenna, sustaining damage only to the antenna and its mounting base.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the miscalculation of the vessel\u2019s draft and \u201cair draft\u201d by the Chief Officer.  This was followed by the eventual allision with the bridge. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) errors in the vessel\u2019s computerized draft calculation software."}
{"activity_id":6313151,"brief":"On 18 November 2017, the Fishing Vessel SENECA (O.N. 532569) was moored port side to the pier at Wanchese Fish Company in Hampton, Virginia, with the vessel bow approximately 10 yards from the J.P. Mugler Bridge. At approximately 1600 LMT the vessel\u2019s master finished unloading his catch and was instructed to move the vessel to another pier at the same facility. He made a series of vessel maneuvers in order to conduct a clockwise turn away from the pier, and the vessel grounded next to the J.P. Mugler Bridge. The master then put a line around the bridge in an attempt to use it as a spring line once the vessel re-floated. The flood current caused the vessel to re-float and subsequently allide with a section of the J.P. Mugler Bridge. \n\nWith assistance from another fishing vessel, the SENECA made it off the bridge and returned to the dock at Wanchese Fish Company. A post casualty inspection found that the starboard bow sustained minor damage to the hand rail and the upper hull plating, and six rudder collar bolts and a portion of the rudder collar itself had fractured. A dive survey found no underwater damage to the shaft, propeller, rudder, or hull.\n\nThrough its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event to be the grounding of the SENECA. Without an ability to back off the bottom and move clear of the bridge, the vessel allided with the bridge as soon as the rising tide lifted the SENECA off the bottom. Causal factors contributing to this casualty were: 1) the failure of the master to provide an adequate margin of safety while shifting the SENECA to a different berth; and 2) the flooding tide that caused a substantial current towards the J.P. Mugler Bridge.\n\nRecommended closing this incident investigation activity without a referral to enforcement."}

{"activity_id":6314089,"brief":"On November 26, 2017, at approximately 18:30, the HONG KONG BRIDGE lost propulsion while outbound from the Port of Long Beach. The vessel was brought safely to anchorage D5 by two assist tugs.  The servo oil pumps had become air-locked and unable to pump oil at the required pressure, resulting in a low pressure in the servo oil pumps.  The low pressure was the result of air being introduced into the servo oil system by an open vent valve, following replacement of filters while the vessel was in port. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the failure of the servo oil pump, which caused an automatic main engine shutdown.  The casual factor that contributed to this incident was the introduction of air into the servo oil system following the replacement of filters while the vessel was in port."}
{"activity_id":6314754,"brief":"On 21 November 2017 at approx. 10:25 local time the towing vessel CODY BOYD (ACBL) experienced a complete loss of propulsion, steering, and power. The towing vessel and 14 barges (8 loaded (3 red flag)\/6 empty (1 red flag)) drifted backwards downriver and the starboard rear barge in the tow allided with a protection cell of the Pearl R\/R bridge causing 4 empty barges (1 empty red flag) to break away from the tow and become pinned between the protection cell and the right descending bank (RDB). The CODY BOYD continued to drift downbound with the remaining 10 barges attached. The towing vessel ERNA E HONEYCUTT arrived on-scene and assisted the CODY BOYD to the RDB. The towing vessel COOPERATIVE MARINER arrived on-scene and kept station in the vicinity of the Pearl R\/R and monitored the 4 empty barges pinned against the bank. The  CODY BOYD was able to eventually restart her engines and restore full ship's power and propulsion systems.  The cause of the propulsion failure was determined to be water intrusion in the day tank due to a faulty hatch seal. \n\nThe bridge was inspected with no damage to the protection cell. All barges were inspected with no damage found. The cause was determined to be water intrusion into a day tank due to a faulty gasket on a topside hatch covering.

Corman Railroad Bridge upper guide pier at MM126.5 on the Cumberland River.  The vessel was approaching the bridge in a northerly direction to transit the right descending span of the bridge with 200 passengers and crew at approximately 2.3 knots.  The bridge was notified by the vessel of the approach initiating the rotation of the bridge counter clockwise at approximately 1615 to allow the vessel to proceed.  As the vessel approached at approximately 1620 local time, the port stern quarter was set toward the pier by southerly winds affecting the large sail area of the vessel.  The vessel port stern quarter scraped along the pier causing cosmetic damage to the vessel and breaking off a red navigation light fixture and platform from the pier.  The vessel continued transit through the bridge without further incident en route to Dover, TN.  \n\nThe Coast Guard investigation identified bridge resource management gaps regarding delayed communications between navigation watchstanders and wind conditions on approach to the bridge, as causal factors to the allision.  Onscene witness described winds and gusts up to 15 mph and local weather reports indicate winds were up to 25 mph and gusting to 32 mph in a southerly direction.

{"activity_id":6320431,"brief":"On December 6, 2017 at 0005, while moored and engaged in cargo operations at Conley Terminal, Boston Harbor, the Panamanian flagged containership HELSINKI BRIDGE broke away from the dock following failure of the single mooring bitt that was holding the vessel's bow lines. After the bitt failed, the remaining lines parted in sequence, from forward to aft, allowing the ship's bow to swing away from the pier. As the bow continued to swing, the bulbous bow allided with Black Falcon Cruise Ship Terminal, located across from Conley on the opposite side of the Reserved Channel. The vessel Master activated the bow thruster and dropped the port anchor in an attempt to stop the swing of the bow. Assist tug JUSTICE was alongside within 20 minutes of the break away to assist in holding the vessel stationary. A Harbor Pilot boarded the vessel and piloted it to Broad Sound anchorage without further incident. No injuries or pollution resulted from the casualty. Damage to Conley Terminal was limited to the broken bollard casting with replacement cost of $20,000.  Black Falcon Terminal sustained $550,000 in damage. A dive survey conducted on the HELSINKI BRIDGE found no structural damage to the vessel, however replacement cost for the parted lines amounted to $40,500.  \n\nWhen the vessel arrived in Boston on December 5, 2017, the crew and docking pilot were aware that elevated wind conditions were forecast for that evening and the docking pilot advised the vessel Master to set five bow lines, five stern lines, two forward spring lines and two aft spring lines. Once the vessel was dockside, the Chief Mate took his position on the forecastle and directed line placement.  He directed the 5 head lines to be placed on 3 different mooring structures, but was told that the two forward bollards could not be used due to dock construction. The Chief Mate alerted the vessel Master of the issue and completed the mooring evolution with placement of all five headlines on one mooring structure.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the failure of the single mooring bitt on which the 5 headlines were placed. Once the single mooring bitt failed, the additional strain placed on the remaining lines exceeded their strength and they began to part in sequence from forward to aft as the vessel's bow swung away from the dock. As the vessel's bow continued to swing, the bulbous bow allided with the Black Falcon Terminal dock, damaging pilings and the dock's concrete deck. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) limited availability of mooring appurtenances for the vessel's assigned mooring location, (2) the vessel Captain's decision to place five mooring lines on one bitt, (3) the Docking Pilot did not verify the safety of the vessel's mooring arrangements prior to departure, (4) condition of the single mooring bitt prior to failure, and (5) Conley Terminal did not consider the vessel's mooring needs and available accommodations when directing the vessel's mooring location."}

During the morning of the 29th, the INDIAN DAWN transited approximately 800 yards from the Great Lakes facility to Colonna\u2019s Shipyard in order to bring a barge from the shipyard to the Great Lakes facility. After successfully completing that barge transfer, the INDIAN DAWN made fast to the stern of the 277-foot dredge barge G.L. 63 (O.N. 922736) at the Great Lakes facility. The INDIAN DAWN and G.L. 63 then transited west along the Elizabeth River towards Colonna\u2019s Shipyard. Just before Colonna\u2019s Shipyard, the INDIAN DAWN and G.L. 63 passed underneath the Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge #5 at a slow rate of speed due to the restricted waterway and the close proximity of the final destination. As the tug and barge passed underneath the railroad bridge, a gust of wind hit the port side of the barge and caused the barge to allide with the Railroad Bridge #5 north side fendering system. \n\nAfter the G.L. 63 allided with the fendering system, the tug and barge continued to Colonna\u2019s Shipyard so the G.L. 63 could begin a scheduled maintenance period. Norfolk Southern personnel conducted a visual inspection of the fendering system and reported no damage to the structure, and a visual inspection of the G.L. 63 side shell identified no new damage to the barge. \n\nThrough its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event to be the allision of G.L. 63 with the Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge #5 fendering system.

On March 26, 2018, at approximately 2145, while enroute to approach the Bayou Dularge Bridge, the master noticed the steering system was not responding appropriately, failing to follow direction from the bridge. While still operating at same speed and course, the master attempted to correct system by switching pumps, but steering system was still not responding. Subsequently, he directed the tankerman on watch to the steering system\/pumps to verify condition of equipment and attempt to correct issue with steering. Simultaneously, the master reduced the speed of the UTV and attempted to put the vessel and barges in reverse to avoid an allusion with the bridge. Tankerman reported no visible issues with the steering system or pumps, and master speed reduction and change is course direction was not sufficient to avoid an allusion. At approximately 2200, the barge GM5020 allided with the Bayou Dularge Bridge. \n\nThe allision resulted in damages to the bridge and the barge GM5020. Bridge had some concrete section affected, but traffic (road and maritime) was never stopped\/affected, and no significant structural damages have been reported. GM5020 had an indent of 12 feet X 01 foot X 03 feet, on the stern section in the starboard side, in way of the bulwark, with water ingress observed by crew. A portable pump was placed on the barge to empty the affected space, and the pump was able to put out water at a faster rate than the water ingress rate. No discharge of oil was observed, and indent did not affect areas near cargo holding sections.  On March 26, 2018, at approximately 2330, USCG Sector New Orleans Command Center received notification of incident. MSU Houma Duty Marine Inspector and Duty Investigation Officers attended the vessel on March 27, 2018, at approximately 0115, to conduct post-casualty inspection. No injuries were reported. No damages were reported to have occurred to GM5009 or the KAREN PAPE as a result from the allision.  A technician from Rio Controls & Hydraulics INC (aka Rio Marine INC) attended the vessel while USCG MSU Houma personnel was onboard, to conduct a service inspection of the steering system. The technician tested the system, but did not find any operational abnormalities. Test conducted while UTV had no barges attached, and while moored in area of channel with low current. \n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the reduction of the KAREN PAPE\u2019s steering. This event was followed by the allision of GM5020 with the Bayou Dularge Bridge, and by the progressive flooding of GM5020. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty included: (1) the operational failure of the KAREN PAPE\u2019s steering system, (2) the delayed reaction from the master to avoid the allision, delaying the reduction of speed and change of course\/direction of vessel and barges, (3) the inadequate preventative mechanisms installed to avoid or minimize depth of indents on barges."}
{"activity_id":6385347,"brief":"On March 16, 2018, at approximately 15:08, the container vessel BANGKOK BRIDGE lost electrical power while mooring in the Port of Long Beach, CA.  The vessel\u2019s #3 generator low lube oil pressure switch is normally set to shut down the generator down when the pressure falls below .35MPa. The switch was inadvertently set to .43MPa. The normal operating pressure for the generator is between .40 and .50MPa. When the bow thruster was brought online and powered by the #3 generator, the generator fell to .43MPa, causing the generator to shut down. The #4 generator automatically started and was being brought in parallel with the #1 and #2 generators. Before the #4 generator was brought fully online, the vessel\u2019s crew brought the bow thruster online, causing an overload on the electrical system. All three generators tripped offline, resulting in a loss of power.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the #3 generator tripping offline due to the low lube oil pressure. This was followed by the #1, #2, and #4 generators tripping offline due to an electrical overload and a subsequent loss of power.  This was followed by the vessels loss of propulsion.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty were the low lube oil pressure being set improperly and the crew bringing the bow thruster online prior to the generators being in full operational status."}

Once free, the master maneuvered the tug and barge out of the channel and back into deeper water. The crew then conducted a preliminary damage assessment and found the freight barge S-2006 had sustained a 4-foot gash on her starboard side, numerous smaller gashes and dents along the side shell of the barge and a 12-inch diameter hole below the 3-foot draft mark as well. They also found the CHAMORRO\u2019s starboard shaft had three wraps of the towline around it with no damage to the propeller or shaft. The master was able to remove the towline from the shaft.\n\nBased on the initial damage assessment, the barge was moored off of Wake Island awaiting additional resources in assessing the condition of the barge and cargo. On 4\/4\/2018, the barge broke free of its mooring and regrounded on another section of reef. This caused additional damage to the hull plating which ultimately resulted in the determination that the barge was a total constructive loss.\n\nThe Owner arranged, through the Environmental Protection Agency and the Coast Guard, for a deep water disposal of the barge. Most of the cargo was off loaded to shore, the barge was then refloated, brought into deep water and sunk in approximately 3000 fathoms of water.\n\nThe investigation found the initiating event was vessel maneuvering which resulted in the grounding of the barge. Causal factors for the initiating event include a loss of situational awareness, failure to follow good marine practices for short tow while entering a restrictive channel."}

As the vessel proceeded, it began to get closer to the bank, contacting vegetation until going aground at the port lead barge (HMT 402) on the bank near mile marker 185.5. After grounding, the stern of the towing vessel then began to move with the current down river alliding with a tank barge, HFL 3007, which was moored at the MPLX Marathon facility on the opposite bank of the Cumberland River.  The HFL 3007 was prepared for a product transfer of gasoline to the facility until personnel shut down the operation in anticipation of an allision as the vessel began to top around.  After alliding lightly with the HFL 3007, the stern continued to top around and allided with a dock piling at the Marathon MPLX facility.  After grounding on the bank, the pilot was intentionally pushing the tow head into the bank to slow the progression of his stern down river and in an attempt to maintain control which proved unsuccessful.  The current then caused couplings to break setting the tow adrift in two barge sections.  The aft string, ING 1658 and H 411B, floated down river and allided with the upper protection pier of the Walking Horse and Eastern RR bridge at MM 185.2 CBR, coming to rest parallel with the right descending bridge supports.  The lead barges, HMT 402 and HMT 314, were recovered by an assist vessel that approached from the down river side, fleeting them on the right descending bank a short distance down river.  SOHV USCG issued a SMIB notifying mariners that the channel was blocked IVO MM 185 CBR.  The Walking Horse & Eastern Railroad Bridge was also secured to rail traffic to allow the recovery of the barges.\n\nThe marine employer conducted drug and alcohol testing on the pilot and brought onboard a surveyor to conduct a third party damage assessment of the barges.  Additional personnel were also brought onboard to initiate a barge recovery operation from the bridge.  The barges were removed by lining up the M\/V DONNA H FURLONG and another M\/V bow to bow to increase horsepower and maneuverability in the high current flow adjacent to the bridge.  The barges ING 1658 and H 411B were recovered successfully from the bridge without further incident.  The surveyor identified damages to the H 411B and HMT 314.  Though no bridge damages were apparent at the time of the incident, damages were identified to the bridge protection pier after the water receded requiring repairs to a metal band that had come loose.  It cannot be determined if that damage is attributed to this incident.\n\nThe investigation revealed that the pilot brought his tow too close to the left descending bank upon clearing the MLK bridge.  The pilot could not bring the tow of the four loaded barges far enough off the bank to maintain headway and subsequently grounded the head of the tow and lost control of the vessel stern.  Further subsequent events include alliding with the HFL 3007 and Marathon MPLX facility piling, tow breakaway and bridge allision at the Walking Horse & Eastern R\/R Bridge.  Damage estimate was provided by attending surveyor equaling $45621 to the two damaged barges."}

{"activity_id":6469585,"brief":"On 26 June 2018, at approximately 1542 hours, the towing vessel CHRISTY was south bound with six empty barges. The Master had an assist tug while transiting through the Morgan City VTS zone. A micro burst weather event occurred causing 27 to 30 knot winds from the east as the tow approached the Morgan City railroad bridge. The lead starboard barge allided with the dolphin (fender system) in front of the west piling of the bridge. There was no pollution or injuries associated with incident. The impact on the dolphin of the bridge caused the 6 face wires in the towing configuration to break, the tow held together as the Master backed off the dolphin and proceeded to the west bank to reconfigure the barges. Initial estimate to the barge that sustained damage was about $10,000. The bridge tender provided no estimate but the damage to the dolphin does not exceeded $100,000. Following the allision with the bridge dolphin the vessel had to back down and came close to hitting the Highway 90 bridge that was behind the towing vessel but there was no evidence of damage to the vessel or the Highway 90 bridge. Facilities on the west bank of the Atchafalaya came into close proximity to the barges, and possible contact as the barges were being reconfigured. There was no evidence on the barges or the towing vessel on their starboard side to show that they had made contact or allied with any structures along the bank. The likely cause of this allision was an unforeseeable micro burst weather event that had a strong impact on the sail area of the empty barges. The Master had already taken steps to mitigate the maneuverability hazards by having an assist towing vessel, exceeding minimum horsepower requirements for the tow."}

This resulted in no damage to the bridge; but, the vessel\u2019s mast was bend back about 15 to 20 degrees.  The cost to repair the damaged bent mast was about $2,500.00.  \n\nDuring the time of the incident, the vessel was operating under previous owners, Higman Barge Lines\u2019 Safety Management System (SMS).  Since then, the vessel is now under the SMS of Kirby Inland Marine which states that any navigational bridge watch shall not commit to transiting any bridge while it is in the down or closed position without first receiving confirmation from the bridge tender that the air gap is safe.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event was the vessel's mast pole alliding the underside of the Bayou Dularge Bridge.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: 1) The vessel\u2019s master neglected to request to the bridge tender that the bridge be opened; 2) Also, the master did not confirm with the bridge tender the vessel had sufficient overhead clearance; 3) Depending of tide, the bridge\u2019s air gap is about 50 feet in the down position.  Thus, had the master lowered the vessel's mast pole before going under the bridge, the vessel would have cleared the underside of the bridge by about 3 feet."}

The allision knocked off the anchor light and wind indicator. There was no other damage to the vessel, its tow or the bridge. The employer determined alcohol was not a factor in the allision. Initial damage estimate provided by the employer was $2500. The actual cost of repairs to the mast and affected navigation equipment was approximately $1655.00, as stated by the vessel's Port Captain during a phone interview.\n\nDuring a phone interview the pilot related that when the vessel is operating on the Illinois Waterway, he usually lowers the upper section of the vessel's retractable mast because there are no lights on that section of the mast that the vessel needs while transiting up the waterway. The pilot stated that he had lowered the upper mast section about a day prior to the bridge allision, and that another crewmember had put the mast back up and did not pass the information on to him. Pilot took responsibility for the allision, stating that he should have verified the position of the mast when he assumed the watch but made the mistake of assuming that the mast was still lowered.\n\nBased upon the evidence collected during this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the cause of the casualty was the pilot not verifying the position of the upper retractable section of the vessel's mast when he assumed the watch. When the pilot took the watch he assumed that the mast was still lowered when it wasn't, and that ultimately led the upper section of the mast alliding with the Ottawa Railroad bridge as he attempted to navigate the vessel under the bridge."}

{"activity_id":6576405,"brief":"On 03 November 2018, at approximately 0642, the 44 foot Uninspected Towing Vessel (UTV) CAPT. JIM pushing ahead barge MISS COLLETTE II departed Hot Energy dock in Houma, LA with two crewmembers onboard, the master and a secondary master. During the south transit to Cocodrie, LA, the master of the UTV CAPT. JIM hailed the Houma Navigational Canal Swing Bridge one half mile away to request the bridge to open so the master could transit through. Due to other vessel traffic in the area, the Master of CAPT. JIM made passing arrangements with the north bound Motor Vessel CHRIS W and the Towing Vessel SVI for vessel traffic sequence through the Houma Navigational Canal Swing Bridge passage. Once the two vessels completed the passage through the bridge opening, the master of the UTV CAPT. JIM began to maneuver his UTV with the barge MISS COLLETTE II through the bridge opening. While in the bridge passage, the bridge operator closed the Houma Navigational Canal Swing Bridge. The bridge struck the starboard side of the barge MISS COLLETTE II and pushed the barge into the east retaining wall. The bottom of the bridge became wedged onto the starboard cleat of the barge MISS COLLETTE II.\n\nThe bridge impact onto the barge detached the south east hydraulic roller wedge ram rendering the bridge shutdown to vehicle traffic. When the impact and consequential detachment of the bridge hydraulic roller wedge ram occurred, it created a hydraulic fluid leak onto the barge and navigable waterway. The bridge sustained approximately $45,000 in damages. The MISS COLLETTE sustained damage consisting of a two inch by four inch inset to its forward starboard spud, three feet of the forward oil containment coaming and three stanchions to its starboard side hand rail. The damage totaled approximately $10,000.\n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the bridge closing on the barge MISS COLLETTE II. This was followed by the bridge striking the barge until the barge was pinned against the bridges' east retaining wall. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) lack of clear communication between passing vessels and the bridge operator, (2) bridge operator keeping insufficient tracking record of transiting vessels, (3) not broadcasting via VHF that the bridge will close so vessels in the area knew not to transit."}
{"activity_id":6576603,"brief":"On 17OCT2018, Sector Ohio Valley command center received notification from the Inspected Towing Vessel (ITV) ENID DIBERT (ON 1044131) of an allision that occurred between a barge (uninspected and loaded coal barge) in the ENID DIBERT 's tow and the Try Street Railroad Bridge.  The ENID DIBERT was upbound near mile marker 1 on the Monongahela River pushing 15 loaded coal barges.  The Master of the ENID DIBERT reported the head of the tow was initially passing through the bridge span as planned, but unexpectedly the head of the tow was set to starboard by river current.  When the master noticed the tow being set to starboard he realized that he could not completely overcome the effects of the current, so he backed down and stopped the forward movement of the tow.  With no forward movement, the forces of the current pushed the barge into the Try Street Railroad Bridge.  Once along side the bridge, the master of the vessel was able to swing the head of the tow back to port, align the tow for safe passage through the bridge span and continue under bridge without further contact.  During the allision with the bridge several wires were broken ($1,200) on the port side of the tow, however there was no damage to the barge that contacted the bridge.  The bridge owners reported there were no damages sustained to the bridge.  The vessel's Master was tested for alcohol as required by company policy and test was found to be.  There were no injuries or pollution as a result of this marine casualty.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the barge and the bridge.  The master had made this trip several times before during similar river and weather conditions.  Despite the similar river stage\/weather conditions to previous trips, this trip's river currents were reported (by the master) to be stronger than anticipated.  In addition, the master reported that the prevailing winds at the time of the incident were blowing from starboard to port in the vessel's direction of travel.

At the same time, the 54-foot recreation vessel CAF\u00c9 PETRON (O.N. 1240010) was transiting south on the Southern Branch Elizabeth River at approximately 14 knots and was approaching the Gilmerton Bridge from the north. The Gilmerton Bridge operator began raising the bridge for the ELLIE J and SJ 160 to pass underneath, but he saw the CAF\u00c9 PETRON approaching the restricted visibility turn at the bridge and attempted to contact the CAF\u00c9 PETRON on channel 13 without success. Due to CAF\u00c9 PETRON's rapid approach to the restricted visibility turn and narrow channel underneath the bridge, the ELLIE J began sounding the danger signal and backing down as the tug and barge passed underneath the Gilmerton Bridge. The bridge operator was able to hail the CAF\u00c9 PETRON on channel 16 and the CAF\u00c9 PETRON stopped short of the Gilmerton Bridge.

The vessel proceeded as planned and approached the San Francisco Ferry Terminal. The Master slowed the vessel and waited for the vessel traffic in the area to clear. The Master then began maneuvering to bring the vessel into its slip at the San Francisco Ferry Terminal. \n\nAt approximately 1430, while the vessel was approaching the outer berth mooring location, the Master realized he did not have throttle control on the port bridge wing. The vessel struck the San Francisco Ferry Terminal in three locations prior to the Master being able to declutch the vessel\u2019s port engine. The port engine's revolutions per minute (RPMs) remained at approximately 1140 during all three of the allision events.\n\nThe vessel sustained visible damage to the bow\/port bow section of the vessel (all above the waterline).  A three-foot fracture was visible on the bow approximately five feet above waterline.  Another inset was observed approximately 10-feet after of the stem approximately nine-feet above the waterline. A crewmember sustained minor injuries.\n\nAll five crewmembers (Master, Relief Master, three deckhands) were directed to undergo post-casualty drug and alcohol testing.\n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event (first unwanted outcome) was the Master's inadvertent and unknown activation of the Port Main Engine's RPM Backup Mode. The initiating event caused the subsequent loss of vessel maneuverability while the vessel was alongside the pier. The Master did not realize that control of the port engine's RPMs was locked at the navigation bridge's center control console location. The primary causal factors that led to the accidental Backup Mode activation and loss of vessel control were:  \n1) The lack of a physical cover to prevent accidental touching or bumping of the rocker-style switch that moves the RPM controls from Auto to Backup Mode; \n2) The lack of an audible or visual alarm that would alert the vessel operator that the main engine's RPM control modes were switched from Auto to Backup; \n3) The Master's failure to adhere to company policy and guidance regarding transferring control stations onboard the SAN FRANCISCO and;\n4) The inaccurate information contained within the automated propulsion controls operating manual pertaining to the transferring of control stations onboard the SAN FRANCISCO.\n\nThe next subsequent events occurred when the vessel allided with the outer berth, inner berth, and finally a pedestrian walkway located at the San Francisco Ferry Terminal. There were no failed or inadequate defense factors or latent unsafe conditions that could have reasonably prevented these allisions from occurring following the initiating event because the master did not have ample enough time to respond to the loss of vessel propulsion control. Similiarly, there were no failed or inadequate defense factors or latent unsafe conditions that directly led to the vessel and facility damage or the minor injuries sustained by the crewmember located on the bow of the vessel, once the allisions occurred.\n\nWhile not a direct causal factor, the investigation concluded that the U.S. Coast Guard failed to provide proper project management oversight during the automated propulsion control system's installation in December of 2015.  The investigation did not find conclusive proof that such oversight, with associated testing procedures, would have necessarily identified the inconsistencies between the automated control manufacturer's manual and actual control system operations. However, it is reasonable to believe that these flaws may have been discovered by proper Coast Guard inspection oversight during design verification and periodic testing procedures."}

The master states that an unanticipated current shift set the vessel toward the bridge causing the starboard decorative exhaust stack to allide with the open swing bridge structure. \n\nThe investigation determined that the initiating event was the P\/V AMERICAN DUCHESS allision with the RJ CORMAN RAILROAD BRIDGE.  Causal factors include; the master's anticipation of being set toward the right descending riverbank and away from the bridge\u2019s swing structure, based on a previous down bound transit.  The vessel was set toward the left descending riverbank\/swing bridge structure and did not have sufficient maneuvering allowance\/space for course correction to avoid the allision.  Post incident, the bridge remained fully operational with superficial damages identified by engineering survey.  Damage to the vessel was cosmetic in nature."}

{"activity_id":6593759,"brief":"On 03 Dec 2018, at approximately 1920, the CROSBY RAM was under way with the LB ROBERT in tow on the Houma Navigation Channel at Mile Marker 23. The MISS CROSBY and the CROSBY HUNTERT were acting as tethers for the LB ROBERT, both the vessels were positioned behind the LB ROBERT to assist the CROSBY RAM control the movement of the LB ROBERT. While approaching the Dulac Pontoon Bridge the master of the CROSBY RAM relayed the plan to the crews of the two other vessels and the crew of the LB ROBERT. While making its way through the Dulac Pontoon Bridge the CROSBY RAM noticed the LB ROBERT was drifting too far to the starboard side and the master gave verbal directions to the vessels in the rear to correct the movement. The vessels were unable to make the corrections necessary and the master of the LB ROBERT engaged the thrusters on the vessel, which lessened the impact on the bridge. After the LB ROBERT made contact on the bridge the master of the LB ROBERT continued to use the thrusters to move the LB ROBERT away from the bridge. \n\nThe CROSBY RAM and the two other vessel were able to gain positive control of the LB ROBERT and continued their transit to the CROSBY shipyard in Houma LA. The bridge supervisor stated there was minimal damage to the Dulac Pontoon Bridge. The fairlead and the pulley were knocked out of place making the bridge stuck in the open position until the repairs were made the following day. \n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the bridge being struck by the LB ROBERT.

During the transit, and while in the channel, the vessel's Master reported the ITV grounded on an uncharted object.  As a result, wires broke on the barges in tow and the two lead barges broke free of the tow and continued forward motion towards the CSX TRANS. RAILROAD BRIDGE.  The two barges that broke free were headed up river and lost the majority of their headway before alliding with the CSX TRANS. RAILROAD BRIDGE.  The ITV was able to free itself from its grounded position and recover both of the barges that broke free.  The tow of 3 barges was reassembled and the vessels continued on their intended voyage.  There were no reported injuries, pollution or damage to the barges or bridge.  The damage reported in the incident was limited to 4 broken wires and a ratchet.\n\nThis grounding occurred in waters that were reported by the USGS to have a depth greater than the 8.5ft the ITV was drafting.

The ZEUS was southbound pushing two empty anhydrous ammonia barges abreast (side by side).\n\nApproximately 15 minutes prior to the allision, the master of the ZEUS had made VHF contact with the bridge tender, indicating they were southbound with two barges abreast. The bridge tender relayed that the bridge was up and the master of the ZEUS replied they were continuing south.  When the head of the ZEUS\u2019s tow was approximately 100 yards upstream of the Peoria Bridge, the bridge tender announced twice on VHF 16 that they were intending to lower the bridge. The master of the ZEUS did not hear the callouts and only realized the bridge was being lowered when the bridge mounted channel centerline lights had changed from green to red. The Peoria Bridge tender did not hear the ZEUS master call out on VHF 16 inquiring if they were lowering the bridge on them. Simultaneously, the master of the ZEUS shifted both throttles to full astern but the effort was insufficient to stop the tow in time due to the ZEUS\u2019s headway speed of approximately 6 knots and the close proximity to the bridge.  The master of the ZEUS remained in the pilothouse throughout the allision but only received minor injuries including small cuts and bruises, no other crewmembers sustained any injuries. Upon passing through the bridge, the master of the ZEUS was able to find the throttles amongst the debris and bring the main engines to neutral. The nearby fleeter ITV RIVER EAGLE observed the allision and immediately faced up to the ZEUS and safely maneuvered it to the adjacent bulkhead immediately south of the Peoria Bridge on the right descending bank. When the top of the ZEUS\u2019s pilothouse carried aft along the vessel\u2019s superstructure, it subsequently struck the hydraulic oil storage tank mounted on the aft deck of the 01 level, causing a rupture in the tank resulting in the spill of approximately three gallons.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of the ZEUS with the Peoria Bridge, which caused a temporary closure of the river to vessel traffic and a temporary closure of the bridge to rail traffic. This was followed by the resulting discharge of oil into the Illinois River. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the inappropriate lighting conditions in the bridge tender\u2019s office, (2) the bridge tender\u2019s failure to follow company policy resulting in a lack of situational awareness, (3) the bridge tender\u2019s use of a bad rule to validate vessel traffic prior to lowering the bridge, and (4) the ZEUS\u2019s master\u2019s failure to hear VHF transmissions warning of lowering the bridge. It was determined that no reasonable defense existed which would have prevented the subsequent oil spill.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, the vessel representatives of the ZEUS updated the estimated costs of repairs from approximately $200,000 to a cost exceeding the $500,000 threshold for a major marine casualty. After discussion with CG-INV and Sector Upper Mississippi River, the investigation was kept at the informal level and NTSB was not notified due to the notification of the increased cost coming significantly later in the investigation."}

{"activity_id":6612921,"brief":"On January 20, 2019, the towing vessel BARBARA ANN was underway, having just left Weber Fleet at mile 167, pushing two loaded tank barges. The BARBARA ANN was intending to back down through the Sunshine Bridge and then top around in the river below the bridge.  As the vessel was falling with the current, the tow started to swing out and the Captain decided to let it continue to swing and attempted to top around above the bridge, instead of below like originally planned. At approximately 1115, the port bow of the lead barge (K29051) made contact with the center span of the Sunshine Bridge. \n\nThe K29051 sustained damage to the port head log. The wooden fender on the bridge pier was damaged and a small scrape was observed in the cement. \n\nAs a result of its investigation the Coast Guard determined the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the K29501 and the Sunshine Bridge pier. This was followed by the damage to the barge and the bridge fender system.  The casual factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the Lower Mississippi River being in a major flood stage causing stronger river currents and dynamic eddies and (2) the Master's incorrect assessment of how much distance the tow would need to clear the bridge pier.\n\nConducted descoped Investigation of vessel allision - accepted Master attestation & supplementary documentation in lieu of on-scene investigation due to low risk incident."}

{"activity_id":6617509,"brief":"On January 17, 2019, at approximately 1355 LMT, the towing vessel JULIA B (O.N. 570858) was underway on the North Landing River in Chesapeake, VA pushing ahead the uninspected empty freight barge DMT 405 (O.N 651469). As the Mate prepared for the transit through the North Landing Bridge, he reduced the speed of the tug and barge from 5 knots to 3 knots and directed the deckhand to the bow of the barge to serve as a lookout. The observed weather conditions were clear skies, with 15 MPH winds from the northeast, and occasional gust up to 17 MPH. As the tug and barge began to transit through the bridge, the bow of the DMT 405 began to fall to the port side and allided with the southeast woodpile fender.\n\nA third party marine surveyor was hired to conduct a bridge assessment by the Army Corps of Engineers. It was determined that the fender \"wales\", which are wooden planks that were bolted horizontally across the woodpile cluster, were cracked and splintered. The red navigation light that was on top of the woodpile fender was knocked over, and rendered inoperable. The navigation light was replaced shortly after the incident. Sector Hampton Roads Investigators were provided with an estimate of $50,000 worth of damage to the bridge fender system. The DMT 405 suffered a 6 inch inset along the port bow rake knuckle approximately 4 feet above the waterline. It did not affect the barge's fitness for service.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the improper vessel maneuver of the JULIA B by the Mate. The subsequent event was the DMT 405 allision with the woodpile fender. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) execution error-attention failure: the Mate failed to take early and substantial action to avoid the allision with the bridge fender system. \n\nRecommend closing the incident investigation activity with a referral to enforcement."}

The starboard main engine (SME) started running poorly.  The engine appeared to be over fueling as evident by the large amount of dark smoke from the stack.  The engineer went to the engine room to troubleshoot and found several error messages on the SME display.  The engineer requested to shut down and restart the SME to see if that would correct the issue.  After several attempts to reset the SME computer and restart unsuccessfully, Harley Marine Services incident line was contacted.  The tow stopped just outside of the Benicia Bridge and the towing vessel AHBRA FRANCO (O.N. 1244419) was dispatched at approximately 1445 local time to relieve the EARL W REDD at approximately 1745 local time.  The EARL W REDD transited to Alameda Reefer Dock (ARD) without incident to await attendance by Caterpillar (CAT) technician and Marine Inspector.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, the U.S. Coast Guard determined the contributing factor was the improper condition (internal failure) of the primary Engine Control Module (ECM) on the SME.

{"activity_id":6624408,"brief":"HOU2019\/0043:On February 11, 2019, the master of the inspected towing vessel (ITV) LINDBERG CROSBY reported that his tow allided with the Interstate 10 Highway Bridge located over the San Jacinto River in Houston, Texas. The LINDBERG CROSBY tug is a 55-foot, 66 gross ton, twin screw towing vessel operated by the Crosby Marine Transportation Company.  The master initially reported he observed damage on the head log of the barge and substantial damage to at least one of the bridge supports on the westbound lanes of the highway. \n\nThe master said he was approaching the bridge with the intent to moor at the Kirby\u2019s Cleaning Fleet just south of the bridge. As he approached the bridge, he initiated a series of maneuvers using the throttle controls.  However, unknown to the master, the starboard engine remained clutched into forward propulsion, even though the master reversed to full astern propulsion. \n\nWith the starboard engine unintentionally clutched forward, increased throttle demand for reverse power resulted in faster forward motion. The master attempted evasive maneuvers to steer the vessel clear of the bridge, but the bow rake head log struck the bridge support. The impact's force sheered the concrete pillar approximately 8' above the waterline. The allision halted the vessel's forward momentum. Upon looking aft, the master determined from the prop wash that the starboard engine was still engaged forward even though the throttles were in neutral. The master went to the engine room and found the air valve actuator linkage for the starboard clutch control disconnected, locking the vessel in forward control. The master reconnected the linkage and regained the clutch control of the starboard engine.\n \nDamage to the barge resulted in a 1-foot wide by 2-inch deep inset on the forward external head log, internal structural deformation of stiffeners, and a damaged vent mast riser. The estimated total cost for repairs is $26,279. Repairs to the bridge's main structural supports are estimated to cost more than $1.5 million.\n\nThe U. S. Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board's joint investigation determined the cause of the casualty to be the failure of the marine gear actuator valve linkage. Possible causes for the failure of the actuator linkage include: shaft locking nut was not torqued to the proper specification, or during use, the shaft rotated in a counterclockwise direction effectively unscrewing from the opposing end linkage and disconnecting. Crosby Tugs has developed a more comprehensive inspection plan, including replacement of the actuator valves every 2.5 years in conjunction with the existing dry-dock schedule for each vessel within their fleet. Case closed."}

The load was picked up by the vessels from a barge fleeting location approximately 1000 feet north of the Huey P. Long Bridge on the right descending bank of the river. Both vessels and their tow headed upriver to perform a topping around maneuver before attempting to navigate through the Huey P Long Bridge. As the tow headed southbound towards the bridge, the tow was not properly lined up to safely pass through the bridge and allided with the fender. Neither towing vessel nor the fendering system was damaged. There is no evidence that drug or alcohol usage was a factor in this incident.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision followed by the material failure (structural damage) to the barges striking the bridge. Contributing factors to the allision included 1) high water river conditions, 2) failure to allow adequate distance to maneuver tow, and 3) inadequate communication with assist vessel.\n\nThis incident met the criteria for a reportable marine casualty and the level of effort was an informal investigation."}

Due to the lack of set past Browns Point, the Trip Pilot made the decision to steer the Hwy 80 \/ Railroad Bridge, instead of flanking.  While the Trip Pilot was coming ahead on the engines in an attempt to bring the tow through Span 3 of the Hwy 80 \/ Railroad Bridge, the tow started to swing towards the east bank and at approximately 0711L the second barge out from the port string (CC-95507B) made contact with Pier 3 of the Hwy 80 \/ Railroad Bridge. \n\nThe initial contact broke the couplings all the way across the tow allowing all 30 barges to break free. After all barges broke away the CC-95507B began to sink in the vicinity of Pier 3.  Barge MTC-825B began to slowly sink and head toward the power plant located at MM 433.  Barges CC-95523B and LTD 405 began to sink and ended up at MM 428 and 429, pushed in by an assist tug on scene.  All other 26 barges floated down river before being rounded up by Ergon Marine assist vessels. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined the initiating event for this casualty was due to the river being at flood stage and still rising, the trip pilot did not expect to be set as early as he did with the bridge, which allowed for the tow to drift towards the bridge during the transit through.   This was followed by the eventual allision and flooding of the CC-95507B, MTC-852B, CC-95523B and the LTD 405. The casual factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the lack of experience by the trip pilot on this particular type of ITV and pilot deciding to steer the bridge rather than flank the bridge."}

The master of the vessel reported the vessel experienced heavy currents and winds from the port side which caused a port-side winch wire and synthetic line connecting two barges to part.  After the parting of the port-side wire and line, the starboard side was subjected to increased forces that ultimately broke the starboard winch wire and line which resulted in the lead two barges separating from the tow and drifting down river unattended.\n\nAfter the parting of the lead two barges, both the barges floated down river, under both bridges, and reportedly did not allide with either bridge.  Both of these barges floated downstream to approximately mile 13.8 of the Monongahela River before grounding along the right descending bank.  Meanwhile, the master of the PAUL MCGINNIS managed to navigate under the bridges with the single loaded barge, but made incidental contact (barge vs bridge) with the Union Railroad Bridge.  There was no damage observed to either the bridge or the barge.  Both grounded barges were recovered from downstream where they had grounded.

Damage to the vessel consisted of a handrail along with radar antenna, mast, and radio antennas which are all located above the pilot house. The bridge suffered damages by the impact including the detachment of 3 pieces of angle iron, approximately 4in diameter by 3ft in length, which fell onto the vessel.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for the casualty was the Pilot not maintaining a proper lookout while navigating the vessel. Leading up to the allision, using personal cellphone, the Pilot was receiving text messages and making personal phone calls. This created a distraction that impacted the ability to safely navigate the vessel. Use of personal or company cellphones while operating a vessel is in violation of company policy."}
{"activity_id":6648613,"brief":"On March 23, 2019, at approximately 0500, the 94.4 foot long towing vessel was underway in the Houma Navigational Canal, in Dulac, LA, with 04 crewmembers (02 licensed Masters and 02 deck hands); the Mate was operating the vessel, and it was the first time the Mate operated a vessel in the area of the incident. The towing vessel was fitted with all required navigational equipment, and equipment was operational. Because the area of navigation was covered with dense fog, the navigational visibility was restricted to approximately 4.3 nautical miles. However, winds and sea conditions were calm\/nominal. The Dulac Pontoon Bridge, in Dulac, LA, was in the closed position for vessel traffic. The bridge was fitted with navigational lights to alert of its location, and was fitted with sound devices operated by the bridge operator. All equipment on the bridge was operational. \n\nAt approximately 0510, the bridge operator used the bridge\u2019s sound device to produce one long blast to alert the vessel of the existence of a head-on\/allision situation. After hearing the blast, using the navigational equipment onboard, the Mate realized the vessel was in close proximity to the bridge. The Mate placed the vessel in reverse to avoid the allision, but such action was not made in ample time.  At approximately 0515, the towing vessel allided with the Dulac Pontoon Bridge, with most of the impact being toward the West side of the bridge, shifting it to its port side. The abrupt pushing movement of the barge portion caused collateral damages to other components of the bridge, including the arms that control the bridge\u2019s movements, supporting bars and brackets, and supporting wooden components. The KAREN KOBY experienced minor damages to the bow portion of the vessel. A marine surveyor from Central Maritime, L.L.C., inspected all damages; surveyor had an initial estimate of property damages to be approximately $100 for damages to the vessel, and approximately $175,000 for damages to the bridge. On May 1, 2019, Terrebonne Parish manager submitted an update on the cost of damages to the bridge, with a new cost estimate of $235,000.\n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of the KAREN KOBY with the Dulac Pontoon Bridge. This was followed by the material failure of the steel in the pontoon. The factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) Operator\u2019s lack of situational awareness while navigating, (2) Operator\u2019s lack of familiarization with area of navigation, (3) Operator\u2019s failure to utilize all available tools for navigation, (4) Operator\u2019s failure to stop navigation in conditions of low-visibility, (5) weather conditions (dense fog) in the area of incident significantly reducing visibility, (6) operator\u2019s failure to maintain proper look-out and (7) operator\u2019s failure to take effective actions to avoid a collision."}

The BRENDA L MURRAY II was upbound near mile marker 1 on the Monongahela River pushing 16 loaded coal barges.  The mate (pilot) of the BRENDA L MURRAY II reported the head of the tow was initially passing through the bridge span as planned, but the head of the tow was set to starboard more than anticipated by river current.  \n\nPrior to the vessel's tow being set to starboard and the pilot finding himself in danger of alliding with a bridge, the pilot had requested the master come to the pilothouse for assistance during a mooring evolution several miles up river.  When the master arrived in the pilothouse he noticed the tow was being set to starboard, the master realized that nothing could be done to completely overcome the effects of the current, so he backed down and stopped the forward movement of the tow to minimize the effects up the impending allision.  With forward movement stopped, the forces of the current pushed the aft starboard barge onto the Liberty Bridge.  Once laid up alongside the bridge, the forces exerted by the current on the port side of the barges caused the lead 12 barges to breakaway completely from the tow and float downstream at the mercy of the current.  The bridge owners reported no significant damages sustained to any of the affected bridges.  All barges were eventually recovered and accounted for, however one barge sank (later recovered) and one barge partially sank (also recovered).  The vessel\u2019s entire crew was tested for alcohol and dangerous drugs; all tests were found to be.  There were no injuries or pollution as a result of this marine casualty.  Damage estimates for the barges are ~ $300k as of 24MAY2019, though this is only an estimate, and final numbers will change as it could be months until all repairs are completed.  These barges are all uninspected and it is difficult to attribute all damages to this incident - some of the the surveyed damage may have been pre-existing. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the barge and the bridge.  The pilot had made this trip several times before during similar river and weather conditions.  Despite similar river stage\/weather conditions to previous trips, this trip the currents were reported to be stronger than anticipated by the pilot.

{"activity_id":6666131,"brief":"At approximately 0900 EST on April 4, 2019, the fishing vessel LITTLE BIT (O.N. 624876) got underway from Williams Seafood in Engelhard, NC, with three persons aboard. The vessel was transiting outbound to conduct commercial fishing in the Atlantic Ocean via the Beaufort Inlet. At approximately 1745, when the LITTLE BIT began approaching the Newport River High Rise and Railroad Bridges, the tide was flooding. The master of the vessel had the crew lower the port and starboard outriggers from the stowed location due to high tide and clearance (approximately 65 feet clearance). While transiting under the Newport River High Rise Bridge and in between the opened Railroad Bridge, the tide pushed the vessel to port towards the Railroad Bridge. This caused the cable on the port outrigger to become fouled in between two of the railroad ties, which pulled the vessel hard to port and snapped off the port outrigger. After the allision, the master was able to maintain control of the vessel and the port outrigger was secured. The master decided to turn back and head back to their homeport in Engelhard, NC. \n\nThe North Carolina State Ports Police observed the incident as it occurred and contacted the Sector North Carolina Command Center who hailed the fishing vessel at Channel 16. After the incident, the master stated there was no further damage to his vessel outside of the outrigger and he was unaware of any damages to the bridge. NC Dept. of Transportation and Norfolk Southern personnel conducted a thorough bridge inspection the following morning on April 5, 2019. There was no damage to the bridge or its installed fendering system. A 2692 was submitted by the vessel's owner and the damages to the vessel were estimated in less than $1,000.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the effect of the tide, which caused the vessel to be push to port while transiting through the bridges. This was followed by the allision with Railroad Bridge when the port outrigger got caught with the railroad ties, resulting in damages to the port outrigger. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the flooding tide pushed the vessel out of alignment while passing through the bridges, and (2) restricted maneuverability with both outriggers in the down position."}

{"activity_id":6681809,"brief":"On May 11, 2019, the towing vessel DANNY TERRAL was underway pushing six barges (three loads of rock and three empties) northbound on the Atchafalaya River near mile 41. The Captain was attempting to bring the tow through the western fixed span of the Krotz Springs Railroad Bridge when the speed over ground began to drop. The first four barges in tow had cleared the bridge when the vessel stopped making way against the current. Despite being full ahead on the engines, the vessel started drifting downriver at .3 mph. The current set the tow towards the west and at approximately 0005 the port middle barge (FRI-707B) in the tow allided with the bridge pier. \n\nThe allision caused multiple tow wires, including the starboard face wire, to part allowing the tow to break free. The Captain was able to push the four lead barges against the bank where an assist vessel held them in place while the DANNY TERRAL recovered the two stern barges without further incident. The port side shell of the FRI-707B suffered approximately $20,000 in damage during the allision. \n\nAs a result of its investigation the Coast Guard determined the initiating event to be the vessel\u2019s loss of maneuverability when it encountered the current in the main channel. This was followed by the eventual allision, damage, and barge break away. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the increased height of the Atchafalaya River causing stronger currents and dynamic eddies, (2) the barge to vessel horsepower ratio being insufficient for the prevailing conditions near the Krotz Springs Railroad Bridge."}

American Samoa Standard Time, USCG Marine Safety Detachment (MSD) received notification from the Master of the Liberian flagged Tank Vessel (TV) HERMITAGE BRIDGE (IMO# 9256913) that the vessel experienced a loss of propulsion. \n\nThe Master reported that at 1500 hrs. while maneuvering the vessel to the pilot station, the T\/V HERMITAGE BRIDGE experienced a main engine shutdown, resulting in a temporary loss of propulsion.  At 1502 hrs. the main engine was restarted and the vessel was moved 12 nautical miles off shore of American Samoa.\n\nThe Chief Engineer discovered that the lube oil shutdown set point was adjusted higher than the turbocharger's operating parameters, which resulted in the low lube oil alarm failing to operate at the manufacturer setting of 0.8 bar. This resulted in low lube oil in the turbo charger leading to the main engine shutting down.  The lube oil pressure switch setting was readjusted to activate at 0.8 bar with no further issues.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, the Coast Guard has determined the initiating event for this casualty was the failure of the low lube oil alarm resulting in a shutdown of the main engine and loss of propulsion. \n\nThe causal factor was the improper setting of the low lube oil shut down was set higher than the turbo chargers operating parameters, which caused a low lube oil pressure within the turbo charger."}
{"activity_id":6703459,"brief":"On May 31, 2019, at approximately 9:22 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, the 670' Great Lakes freighter HERBERT C. JACKSON, owned by the Interlake Steamship Company, was down-bound on the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, OH when the vessel's masthead light struck the Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge (NS1) near the entrance to the river. Approximately 6 inches of the masthead light struck the bridge. The allision caused no damage to the bridge and only minor damage to the vessel's equipment, requiring the masthead light to be replaced. No injuries, pollution or other casualties resulted from this incident. \n\nThe NS1 bridge is a vertical lift bridge that when in the lifted position has a vertical clearance of 98 feet as measured from the low water datum established at 569.2 feet (above sea level). At the time of the casualty the water level was observed to be 574.57 feet (or 5.37 feet above the low water datum); this lowered the relative clearance height of the bridge to 92.63 feet above the water. The vessel at the time of the casualty was calculated to have an air draft of 91.53 feet above the water, therefore giving the vessel an estimated clearance of just over 13 inches. The vessel's air draft is calculated using the fixed total height of the vessel from the keel to the masthead light which is 110.28 feet; the vessel's draft is then subtracted from the total height to give the above water height of the vessel (air draft). At the time of the casualty the vessel's draft was estimated to be 18.75 feet. The vessel's draft is estimated by the loading condition of the vessel including cargo and ballast and confirmed by reading the draft marks on the sides of the vessel. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the U.S. Coast Guard determined the cause of the casualty was the decision to load the vessel to the point that the vessel would only have approximately 13 inches of clearance under the NS1 bridge. This left very little room for any errors including in estimating the draft of the vessel, the water levels at the time the vessel was to proceed under the bridge, or even rounding errors. In reality the vessel had negative 6 inches of clearance under the NS1 bridge or a total error of 19 inches from what was the assumed to be the clearance based on calculations."}

{"activity_id":6742697,"brief":"On 06 July 2019, at approximately 0905, the 288 foot 4169 GT ITC freight barge was underway on the Houma Navigation Canal. The barge was being moved by a 77.6-foot ITV with 2,000 ahead horsepower as the pulling vessel, and a 51-foot ITV with 900 ahead horsepower as the pushing vessel. The pulling vessel was located approximately 100 feet away and toward the center of the barge. The pushing vessel was located directly in contact with the center aft of the barge. The barge was heading north bound through the Houma Navigational Canal Bridge when the starboard bow allided with the fender wall. The master reported that at the time of the allision, the waterway had a strong head current that influenced the movement of the barge, impeding the towing vessel to maintain the steady control of the barge\u2019s movement, allowing the barge to drift into the bridge\u2019s fender wall. The bridge\u2019s opening was approximately 128 feet and the barge was 100 feet wide. The bridge operator reported the allision to the New Orleans Sector Command Center.   \n\nThe allision resulted in no damage to the towing vessel. The barge and bridge sustained minor scrapes. The bridge was fully functional for both, vessel and vehicle traffic. There was no water ingress, injuries or pollution reported.\n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the vessel (barge) maneuver caused by the increased head current. This was followed by the allision of the barge with the bridge\u2019s fender wall. The casual factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) The significant difference in horsepower between the pulling and the pushing towing vessels, (2) insufficient horsepower pushing the barge to compensate the strong current in the area of the bridge, (3) an increased head current in the area of the bridge, compared to the area of the canal before the bridge and, (4) the significant small difference between the width of the bridge area and the width of the barge."}

{"activity_id":6751988,"brief":"On 16 June 2019 at approximately 1140 local time the ELLY LANE, a U.S. flagged towing vessel, allided with the port pier of the Luling Bridge. The ITV ELLY LANE was underway southbound around 26 Mile Point when the downbound gas carrier, OTHINI, made arrangements to overtake the ELLY LANE on their starboard side before the Luling Bridge.  The ELLY LANE backed down from 10 knots to 7 knots which caused the ELLY LANE to be set toward the east main channel span and the lead port barge, CBX 2033, landed on the east bank pier in the main channel span. No damage was noted on the barge. \n\nDamage to the east bank pier was estimated to be $25,000. \n\nAs a result of its investigation the Coast Guard determined the incident meets the requirements of a reportable marine casualty as defined in 46 CFR 4.05-3 as the vessel made an unintentional allision with a bridge. Since the damage was less than $75,000 the incident was downgraded to a data collection activity."}
{"activity_id":6753282,"brief":"Sector Ohio Valley Command Center received a report from the inspected towing vessel (ITV) LADY TEREA (Excell Marine, ON 284004, 5000 HP) that while she was moving 2 barges (1 scrap, 1 empty) at MM 28 OHR (Pittsburgh, PA) the lead barge (CBC 1274) allided with the left descending bank pier of the Vanport Highway Bridge. The ITV reported no damage, pollution or injuries.\n\nCasualty investigators from USCG MSU Pittsburgh attended the vessel to conduct an investigation into this reportable marine casualty.  It was discovered that the LADY TEREA was shifting two barges at a dock and was utilizing assistance from the ITV LONNIE M BELL for the shifting of the barges.  The plan was for the LONNIE M BELL to rig a headline on the head of the barge (upstream) and assist in keeping the head of the barge under control.  The LADY TEREA was made off on the hip of the barges.  The shift began as planned, but the deckhand on the LONNIE M BELL allowed the headline to slip off and the head of the barge unexpectedly began a swing to starboard as a result of river current.  The LADY TEREA was unable to maintain control of the barges, the LONNIE M BELL was unable to reattach the headline in a timely manner, and as a result, the head of the barge (CBC 1274) made incidental contact with the Vanport Bridge pier located adjacent the left descending bank.  In addition to the bridge, prior to alliding with the bridge the the barge made contact with the dock wall causing minor damage to the dock.  After contact with the dock and bridge the barges were safely moved back to the dock without further incident.  State Department of Transportation inspectors evaluated the bridge and reported the bridge sustained minimal damages that would not require repair or warrant securing bridge use.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined the initiating event for this casualty was the barge CBC 1274's allision with a dock and subsequent allision with the Vanport Highway Bridge. These allisions were a direct result of the failure of a deckhand on the ITV LONNIE M BELL to maintain control of the headline rigged between the tug and the barge. The deckhand was a new hire and lack of experience was a contributing factor to this casualty.\n\nRecommend this standard level investigation be closed with no further referrals."}

The M\/V RHEA was transiting east bound along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway near MM 60 when it struck the bridge as it was lifting. The vessel sustained damage to its upper wheel house crow\u2019s nest; but, all communications and radar systems were still operational.  No injuries or pollution reported.  The Bridge Operator confirmed that the bridge was undamaged and operational.  About 4 hours after the allision, a Terrebonne Parish Police Officer administered a breathalyzer test on the mate who was at the helm at the time of the incident, and the result was a BAC of 0.199.  \n\nThe RHEA (soon to be an ITV) got underway from Amelia, Louisiana around 16:30.  The vessel was light boat heading to Dulac to pick-up an oil field barge and then transport that barge back west to Cameron, Louisiana near Lake Charles.  Previously, the vessel had been in the Mississippi River the past 6 weeks or so assisting all types of vessels navigate the high river levels.  That work ended and M\/V RHEA returned to Amelia to wait for new work.  The vessel had a five man crew.  This was the first day for three of the crew.  The mate and the engineer had been on the vessel for weeks.  The mate and another crewmember took the first watch at 1630 CST and according to the other crew members, the mate showed no signs of intoxication or inadequacy.

The bridge allision occurred at 2025.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event was the bridge allision.  This resulted in heavy damage to the vessel's wheel house crow's nest and no damage to the Bayou Dularge Bridge.  The causal factor that contributed to this casualty was that the vessel's operator was intoxicated and failed to properly assess the risk of alliding the bridge."}
{"activity_id":6773140,"brief":"At approximately 0800 CHst on August 05, 2019, the Un-inspected Towing Vessel MANGILAO capsized and sank in the western Pacific Ocean while being towed astern by the towing vessel CHAMORRO. The sinking occurred while both vessels were underway, west bound in the Philippine Sea. Five days prior, the two vessel departed Apra Harbor, Guam in route to Subic Bay, Philippines where the MANGILAO was scheduled to enter dry dock and undergo maintenance. At the time of the sinking, MANGILAO was unmanned and in a dead ship condition with approximately 10,000 gallons of fuel, lube, and hydraulic oils on board.\n\nPrior to sinking, the MANGILAO spent several days being towed astern by CHAMORRO through ever-worsening weather and sea conditions associated with Typhoon Lekima. Sometime in the early morning hours of August 05, 2019, the towline parted, setting MANGILAO adrift. Upon realizing the situation, the CHAMORRO\u2019s Captain turned the vessel around and retraced his previous course, eventually locating the MANGILAO several hours later. Finding the vessel listing heavily and its decks awash, the Captain determined that the situation aboard the MANGILAO was far too hazardous to attempt sending his crewmembers aboard. Additionally, the Captain observed that the MANGILAO\u2019s emergency tow hawser was fouled around its deck and pilothouse, making it impossible to hook another towline to the vessel. Eventually, the vessel, valued at approximately $473,227, capsized and sank. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the pitching and rolling of the MANGILAO through heavy seas associated with Typhoon Lekima. This was followed by the failure of the anchor safety shackle which set the vessel adrift in the turbulent seas. At the mercy of the wind and waves, MANGILAO began suffering from down-flooding resulting in its eventual loss of stability. Additionally, at some point the MANGILAO\u2019s emergency tow hawser being fouled around its pilothouse and deck. Eventually, MANGILAO became so unstable that it capsized, causing it to sink. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the decision on the part of the vessel owners and the Captain to get underway despite the fact that weather forecasts warned of tropical storm systems developing over the intended course, (2) the lack of an inclement weather plan within the tow plan, (3) the hazardous weather and seas associated with Typhoon Lekima, (4) the improper use of a lifting shackle as part of the towing configuration, (5) failure to use the proper towing configuration for the open ocean towing operation, (6) the proximity of the lifting shackle to the MANGILAO\u2019s bow fender, (7) the fact that the MANGILAO was being towed dead ship and unmanned, (8) the questionable condition of the MANGILAO\u2019s water and weather tight hatches and closures, and (9) the fact that the MANGILAO\u2019s emergency bilge pumps were out of commission."}

Upon approaching the Black Bayou Bridge, a swing bridge, the operator placed the vessel in standby while waiting for other vessels to pass through. When it was time for the INDEPENDENCE to pass through the bridge, the operator called out on radio channel 13 to get confirmation from the bridge operator that the bridge was open. After calling out multiple times, the operator of the INDEPENDENCE got no response from the bridge operator. \n\nShortly after reaching out to the bridge operator, the operator of the INDEPENDENCE witnessed another towing vessel pass through the open bridge. The operator of the INDEPENDENCE then called out on radio channel 14 to get in touch with the operator of the Calcasieu Locks, which were just on the other side of the Bayou Black Bridge. The operator of the Calcasieu Locks instructed the INDEPENDENCE to push up against the \"long wall\" while waiting for the locks to open. After receiving these instructions, the operator of the INDEPENDENCE made the assumption that the Bayou Black Bridge was open, even though there was no communication between the operator of the INDEPENDENCE and the operator of the Bayou Black Bridge. Due to it being dark, the operator and crew could not visually confirm the bridge was open. The operator also referenced the vessel's Rose Point navigation system, which displayed a chart of the area and the Bayou Black Bridge. The chart shown on the Rose Point system appeared to show the bridge in an open position, which the operator incorrectly assumed was part of the functionality of the navigation system. \n\nThe operator of the INDEPENDENCE then began to make way towards the Bayou Black Bridge with two deckhands posted on the bow of its forward-most barges. As the INDEPENDENCE got closer to the bridge, the lookouts realized the bridge was closed and relayed this information via radio to the operator. The operator then began to back the vessel down. However, due to the weight of all six loaded barges, the forward momentum of the tug and barges continued and the INDEPENDENCE struck the Bayou Black Bridge at a speed of approximately .5 knots with the port bow of barge GBW-97. This resulted in less than $5,000 in damage to the bridge and no damage to the barges. The bridge was closed for repairs for approximately nine hours."}

The Cape May Bridge commission attended the bridge and estimated approx. $100K worth of damage.  There was no damage to the vessel or the vessel's outrigger.  The bridge was fully functional and tested by Cape May Bridge engineer. \n\nThe Coast Guard determined that the initiating event for the casualty was the strong current due to an ebbing tide at the bridge opening.  The strong current drew the vessel towards the bridge abutment when the stay wire of the outrigger hung up on the bridge catwalk and damaged the bridge.  Additional causal factors for the allision was the Master\u2019s decision to transit through the bridge at night when the current was strong and difficult to see the direction of the current.  Additionally, the lack of any policy that restricts the vessel from transiting through the bridge opening during daylight or tide restricted may have prevented the incident from occurring."}

Long Bridge, at mile marker 106.1 on the Lower Mississippi River. \n\nFollowing the allision, PVBL 58B (ON 1059489, dry cargo covered barge, 200 feet) became partially submerged at MM 98.5. The barge was loaded with urea fertilizer and both the barge and cargo were a total loss as the barged capsized over 180 degrees. The PVBL 58B barge was salvaged and scrapped. ART 35647B (ON 1238116, dry cargo covered barge, 200 feet) sustained a 15 foot inset to the port side shell with no penetration. ART 35227B (ON 1227206, dry cargo covered barge, 200 feet) sustained minor damages. The ITV LOUISIANA LADY did not sustain any damages. The final damage estimate was $173,000 for vessel damages and $486,000 for cargo loss. The initial damage estimate was below $200,000.\n\nInspection of the Huey P. Long bridge was conducted and revealed impact damage to the 4th wale at the center of the upstream nose of Pier II, the 5th wale along the west bank side of the upstream nose was missing, and minor damage on the 2nd wale at the corner of the west bank side of the upstream nose. At the time of the bridge inspection, the Carrollton river gage was recorded at 16.62 feet. No underwater inspection was performed. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event was the ITV LOUISIANA LADY and tow allided with the Huey P. Long Mississippi River Bridge. The tow intended to pass between the preferred channel of Pier I and Pier II, when the current set the tow's heading towards the west bank and the head of the tow allided with Pier II\u2019s nose. \n\nDrug and alcohol testing of the Master was conducted following the incident and determined not a factor in the allision. A 96-hour work\/rest history was not conducted. \n\nThe Huey P. Long Bridge was fully operational following the allision. As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the incident met the reportable marine casualty criteria in 46 CFR 4.05-1 as the allision resulted in property damage that exceeded the $75,000 threshold.

{"activity_id":6809952,"brief":"On 01 Aug 2019, Sector Maryland-NCR received notification of a bridge allision in Ocean City, MD involving a pontoon boat carrying 15 passengers.  The pontoon boat reportedly struck the bridge after experiencing engine issues resulting in the capsizing of the vessel and all 15 individuals entering the water.  All individuals involved were recovered safely and declined on-scene medical services, however, it was later reported that a young girl was taken to the hospital for evaluation after swallowing water and having minor injuries to her head.  The vessel was rented from Under the Bridge Watersports in Ocean City, MD.  The vessel was towed by Towboat US and taken out of the water by the vessel's owner. \n\nFurther investigation revealed the following:\n\nClaims of engine failure were centered around the renter's claims that the engine was lifted after a soft grounding and then could not be trimmed back down.  Pictures of the vessel immediately following the incident show that the vessel's outdrive was in the down position, and was in fact the area to which the tow line was affixed.  In addition, the investigator visited the engine mechanic responsible for the maintenance of the craft and who took possession of the engine after the casualty.  The engine was hooked to a battery and the mechanic was able to show the investigators that there were no issues with the trim functions of the vessel's engine.  Lastly, a bystander on shore was interviewed by investigators and relayed that the vessel was clutched in reverse and making astern propulsion just prior to striking the bridge.  The investigator was unable to corroborate the renter's claims of engine failure as it relates to the engine not being able to be trimmed down after being raised.\n\nInterviews with the operator revealed that the vessel was loaded in excess of the vessel's information plate.  While the vessel was rated for 16 people, it also indicated a maximum passenger weight of 2270lbs.  The weight of the passengers onboard was found to be 3021 lbs.  The capacity plate did indicate an engine of 140hp, and there was a 90hp engine installed.  A call to Godfrey Pontoon Boats was placed and they relayed that the engine rating on a capacity plate is for the maximum allowable hp.  A general rule was used of 40lbs of passenger rate for each hp of the engine and the boat was found to be sufficiently powered given the weight of the 15 passengers despite it being overloaded with regards to the capacity plate.\n\nThere was a matter discovered during the course of the investigation that relates to the Passenger Vessel Safety Act and corresponding federal inspection regulations.  The vessel had 15 passengers onboard a vessel that was bareboat chartered without the crew provided.  Due to the amount of individuals onboard, federal regulations would have classified this vessel as an inspected vessel and therefore subject to the regulations found within 46 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Subchapter T. Because of this, the vessel's owner was issued an LOW and an enforcement activity was opened.  Additionally, significant outreach efforts in the Ocean City area have been initiated to educate similar businesses of the requirements within the PVSA."}

{"activity_id":6816471,"brief":"On September 19, 2019, at approximately 2053 CST, eleven inspected inland tank barges broke free from their moorings at the San Jacinto River barge fleeting area. The barges were carried downstream by strong currents intensified by the recent torrential rains affecting the region and the overflow from the Lake Houston spillway. The barges struck the Interstate-10 Bridge (I-10), causing near-catastrophic damage to the bridge.\n\nThe San Jacinto River Fleet, located just northwest of the Interstate-10 Bridge, has been in operation since 2011 and consists of seven areas, or tiers, where vessels are moored. Several of these tiers consist of steel pilings, while others consist of spud barges. A spud barge is a type of barge that is moored by steel shafts or through-deck pilings, which are essentially pipes driven right into the soil or sand at the bottom of the water to provide stability for the barge. Due to the low clearance of the I-10 Bridge, access to the Jacinto fleeting area is mainly limited to inland tank barges and towing vessels with retractable wheelhouses.\nThe Houston-Galveston area was seriously affected by tropical storm Imelda, which had reached the area on September 17, 2019. Imelda was initially predicted to produce five to ten inches of rain in the area; however, by the time Imelda cleared the area, the storm had produced over forty inches of rain in some areas. This unexpected rain caused significant flooding in the area and pushed Lake Houston into the \"major\" flood stage.\nLake Houston, managed by the Coastal Water Authority, is located northeast of Houston and supplies drinking water for the city. The east fork of the San Jacinto River located in northeast Harris County forms Lake Houston.  The Lake Houston dam has a 3,160-foot long spillway and uses four gates to manage the water level. The two radial gates are designed to release high volumes of water, and the two flashboard gates are used for minor adjustments to the lake level. The lake discharges into and directly affects the lower San Jacinto River. The San Jacinto River runs from Lake Houston in Harris County to Galveston Bay.\nThe rainfall from tropical storm Imelda caused Lake Houston water level to increase rapidly and pushed Lake Houston into a \"major\" flood stage. At that flood stage, an approximate four to six-foot-high water wall was flowing over the spillway and into the San Jacinto River. The natural release of water over the spillway into the San Jacinto River resulted in high water levels and strong currents, which affected areas and vessels downriver.\nCheryl K LLC is owned and operated by the same parties that manage the San Jacinto River Fleet and operates five towing vessels with retractable wheelhouses to conduct its day-to-day fleeting operations. A wheelhouse capable of being lowered is necessary to transit under the I-10 Bridge.  The San Jacinto River Fleet is solely responsible for all vessel movements into and out of the fleeting area. The operating permit status of the San Jacinto River Fleet could not be determined during this investigation and remains under review.\nThe San Jacinto River fleet had eleven barges moored at tier three on September 19, 2019. Two barges were empty, and the remaining nine barges were loaded with different products. The strong river currents on the San Jacinto River caused the synthetic lines securing the barges to tier three to part, and the eleven barges broke free and began drifting.  The barges drifted in a southeasterly direction, eventually grounding just south-southeast of the fleeting area.\nCheryl K had four fleet towing vessels in operation that evening. Three towing vessels worked to remove the two empty barges and tied the barges back up in the fleeting area. Of the remaining nine loaded red-flag barges, one barge grounded, and eight barges floated free and continued to drift towards the I-10 Bridge. Despite Cheryl K's towing vessels' efforts, the eight barges eventually struck the Interstate-10 Bridge fendering system and bridge support pilings. Two barges became lodged under the bridge's west span, and the remaining six barges passed under the bridge.  The allision resulted in damage to numerous barges and caused severe structural damage to the bridge. The Texas Department of Transportation closed the interstate bridge to vehicle traffic in both directions. \nOnce the six barges cleared the bridge, towing vessels secured them by grabbing and pushing them onto the mud bank. Efforts to dislodge the two barges from under the bridge were initially impeded by high water levels and the strong current. However, once the currents abated and the water level receded, the barges were removed without further incident.\n \nThe Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was either an inadequate number of lines or an insufficient breaking strength of the lines employed. The strong river currents, caused by the unanticipated and unpredicted weather event, placed a heavy strain on the soft securing lines which caused them to part."}
{"activity_id":6816643,"brief":"Received a report from MSU Huntington MDO that the ITV CINCINNATI (Marathon Petroleum, 1126162, 2600HP) was pushing 2 empty red flag barges (condensate crude) at MM 1 Big Sandy River when it the lead barge (HSM 3218) allided with the C&O Railroad bridge.  ITV reported no damage to the barge or the bridge. No other damage, injuries or pollution were reported.\n\nThe investigation found that the pilot made an error in judgment when attempting to align his tow to make the bridge.  The pilot admitted to steering too late, allowing the tow to slide too far towards the right descending bank.  When the pilot realized his mistake, he made the decision to allow the tow to land on the right descending bank pier of the C&O Railroad Bridge.  The tow made contact with the bridge towards the stern of the lead barge (HSM 3218).  The pilot was then able to pivot off the pier and transit through the bridge without further incident.

As the ITV CREEK was approaching the bridge, the Captain put a deckhand on the lead barge to help relay the position of the barges when lining up to go through the middle span. The Captain tried to take the slide of the vessel to port off while he was making his approach. Once he took his speed off, the vessel got caught in the upward eddie and held the bow towards the bridge. By the time he noticed what was happening, it was too late to compensate. At 0900 the port lead barge struck the fendering system of the bridge and broke the two starboard barges free. Another tug nearby gathered the two barges and returned them to the ITV CREEK. The name of the barges were not recorded and are not included as MISLE subjects. \n\nAt the time of the incident there was not any traffic in the vicinity. The weather was clear and calm. The current was running hard due to high water.

{"activity_id":6819564,"brief":"On September 9, 2019, Coast Guard Sector Saint Petersburg received a notification from the project manager for a work site used by the uninspected towing vessel KEELBACK (1298632) pushing the deck barge CMS 751 (CG1056096) loaded with concrete pilings concerning the barge alliding with an aid to navigation and a subsequent allision with the Dick Misener bridge in Tampa Bay, Florida.  KEELBACK is a 25 foot uninspected towing vessel and CMS 751 is a 192 foot\/677 gross ton deck barge.  The captain was transiting from Standard Concrete Products in Tampa, Florida to a bridge construction project near Tierra Verde, Florida in KEELBACK pushing ahead CMS 751; KEELBACK had just completed construction on August 28, 2019.  It was the first time that the captain had operated the vessel except for a one-hour familiarization sea trial.  The captain noted that the hydraulic steering had a tendency to stick while conducting the sea trial.  The captain performed this specific transit before with one row of concrete pilings but this time there were two rows of pilings that restricted his visibility to a 12-foot opening centerline of the vessel.  A lookout was positioned on the bow of the barge with a radio to communicate with the vessel captain.  As the tow approached Boca Ciega Bay Daybeacon \"G7\" in the intercostal waterway of Tampa Bay, the lookout informed the captain that he needed to bring the vessel to starboard to avoid the day beacon.  The captain could not correct the course in sufficient time before contacting the day beacon citing a temporary steering failure.  As a result, the day beacon was destroyed.\n\nThe captain continued to push the tow two miles west to the Dick Misener Bridge entrance.  When the tow reached the last marker \"G13\" before the bridge entrance, the captain felt the tow was misaligned and he needed to back down and re-center the tow prior to entry.  The captain backed the vessel down and attempted correct the vessel course, however, there was outward tidal flow that reduced steerage and pushed the tow to the port into a fendering system and a concrete footing of the bridge.  The port engine for KEELBACK overheated and shut down several times as the captain attempted to reposition the tow.  The captain kept the tow steady until a company skiff arrived on scene to push the tow back into the entrance where it successfully passed under the bridge.  During the vessel maneuver, the captain was able to restart the port engine.  An Investigating Officer from Sector Saint Petersburg directed chemical testing for crewmembers directly involved.  The vessel master and crewmember received non-DOT alcohol and chemical testing; results were.\n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event for the allisions with both the aid to navigation and bridge were a reduction in steering.  Causal factors included 1) poor judgment by the company to require a transit with restricted visibility, 2) a failure by the vessel captain to address the restricted visibility, 3) a faulty rudder control joystick, 4) restricted visibility for the vessel captain by the concrete pilings on CMS 751 and 5) and ebb tide that pushed the tow to the port in both allisions.  Subsequent events included 1) An allision with Boca Ciega Bay Daybeacon \"G7\", 2) an allision with the Dick Misener Bridge and 3) several losses of propulsion by the port engine of KEELBACK.\n\nNo other injuries, pollution or waterways obstructions were noted during this marine casualty."}

An assist vessel was present to help the ITV MIKE BIRD with its transit through the area and it attempted to push the tow back into the channel but was unsuccessful.  The pilot of the ITV MIKE BIRD determined that if he maintained the track the vessel was on, he would not be able to navigate through the Crescent RR Drawbridge transit area without an allision occurring, so he began to back the vessel towards the right descending bank.  Although the vessel was backing it continued to move S\/B which led to the tow\u2019s stbd lead barge, the KIRBY 27723 (O.N. 1166472), alliding with the shear fence that runs parallel underneath the bridge.  As a result of the allision the barge wires connecting the ITV MIKE BIRD to the tow were disconnected and the tow vessel lost positive control of the tow.  The pilot of the ITV MIKE BIRD then repositioned the vessel and the crew connected a tow line to the barges along the hip, which enabled the ITV MIKE BIRD to pull the barges up river away from the bridge along the right descending bank.  With assistance from the assist vessel, the ITV MIKE BIRD was able to maneuver the tow to the right descending bank where it moored at the Davenport, IA city front.  As the tow was moored, it allided with the river wall causing damage to concrete structure and metal railing as well as minor scrapes to the hull of the starboard tail barge.  Due to the allision the hull on the stbd bow of the KIRBY 27723  was punctured in two places on the bow rake void.

There was no water ingress, injuries or pollution reported.\n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the vessel (barge) maneuver caused by the increased head current. This was followed by the allision of the barge with the bridge\u2019s fender wall. The casual factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) The significant difference in horsepower between the pulling and the pushing towing vessels, (2) insufficient horsepower pushing the barge to compensate the strong current in the area of the bridge, (3) an increased head current in the area of the bridge, compared to the area of the canal before the bridge (4) the wide turn taken by the pulling vessel when approaching the Dularge Bridge to pass through the bridge navigational area, (5) the inability of the towing vessels to align the barge in the middle of the bridge\u2019s navigational area for safe transit through the bridge area and, (6) the significant small difference of 25 feet between the width of the bridge area and the width of the barge."}

The Master had anticipated that the current, which is typically less than 1 mph, would push the vessel on its starboard side towards the LDB. The current however, was closer to 3 mph and did not set the vessel as much as anticipated, therefore the vessel was aligned to transit the bridge, favoring the RDB and resulted in the allision. The vessel was transiting at approximately 10 mph. There was no damage to the ITV or barges. The bridge, which had been recently painted, suffered dented steel on the sacrificial protection cell and scrapped paint.\n\nAs a result of this investigation, the US Coast has determined pilot error and strong currents to be the cause for this marine casualty."}

The deckhand was standing on the barge serving as a lookout. As the Master began to transit through the bridge, he pushed the barge closer to the north west side in preparation for the upcoming turn that was on the other side of the bridge. The observed weather conditions were approximately 3 knot winds from the southeast, clear skies, and unrestricted visibility. The tide was ebbing. As the Master began to set up for the turn, the current set the barge, and the Master was unable to maneuver away from the bridge. The barge's starboard quarter made contact with the east bridge fender. The lookout walked towards the stern of the barge and did not observe any damage to the barge or towing vessel. The City of Chesapeake Bridge manager conducted a post-accident survey of the bridge. It was discovered that one of the rub plates was missing from the rubber fender. Another rub plate had the connectors sheared off. The City of Chesapeake provided a damage estimate of $9,037.\n\nThe vessel self-reported the incident to the Sector Hampton Roads Command Center. Investigating Officers attended the vessel, which was moored alongside the anchored barge approximately 0.5 miles offshore.

{"activity_id":6852463,"brief":"On August 4, 2019 at about 22:40 CST, the ITV G. BROOKS SPERRY pushing ahead two loaded red flagged barges had the port bow of the tow's lead barge allide the Bayou Dularge Bridge Fender System.  This caused damage to the tow's lead barge, FMT-3212.  Barge FMT-3212 suffered heavy dents to the port bow void all above the waterline and was not taking on water.  Neither the bridge nor the other vessels in the tow reported damage.  The other barge in the tow was the FMT-3063.  Each barge had a length of 297 feet long by 54 feet wide making the tow's total length near 600 feet long.  The Bayou Dularge Bridge span opening is only 125 feet wide.  \n\nThe allision occurred at night with near zero visibility.  The ITV G. BROOKS SPERRY had 2,600 hp with two 1,300 Cummins Engines and this was the vessel's maiden voyage.  The allision occurred as the ITV G. BROOKS SPERRY was underway east bound along the Gulf Intracoastal Water Way (GIWW) approaching MM 59.5 west of the Harvey Lock.  The tow got underway from Sun Oil in Port Author, Texas and was heading to Exxon Chalmette on the Lower Mississippi River.  Each barge was loaded with 22,000 barrels of crude oil.  The master has been a captain for 10 years and has made the transit through this area many times before, but with smaller tow configurations.  This time the master underestimated the current with the larger than normal tow size.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determine the initiating event was barge FMT-3212 alliding the port side bridge fender system.  This caused heavy damage to barge FMT-3212's port bow all above the water line.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:  1) The Bayou Chene Route was closed for larger tow configurations.  A large tow configuration of this size (being 600' long by 54' wide) normally would have bypassed the narrow and congested GIWW through Houma and taken Bayou Chene to the Gulf of Mexico and reentered the GIWW east of Houma.  But, due to the recent Hurricane Barry and local area flood risks, the Bayou Chene Route was shut-off to marine traffic.  2) The Bayou Dularge Bridge Span opening is only 125' wide and the tow width was 54' wide and 600' long.  This left little room for error to prevent the barges from alliding the bridge fender system.  Normally, the barges that pass through this span are only 35' wide by 400' long.  3) Night time operations with near zero visibility make it difficult for any mariner to properly assess collision\/allision risks.  4) The master stated he underestimated the current that he hoped would help set his barges up to make the bridge span opening.  After 10 years of operation, the master stated this was his first incident.  If the Bayou Chene Route were not closed, it is believed this incident would not have occurred."}

At approximately 12:45 p.m., the COLONIAL BELLE navigated under the Marsh Road Bridge at slow bell on a westerly course with a reportedly 6\" clearance between the vessel\u2019s safety rail and bridge.  At approximately 12:50 p.m., Lock 32 on the Erie Canal, which is located approximately 4.5 miles west of the Marsh Road Bridge, locked through a vessel transiting east and dumped approximately 2.77 million gallons of water into the Erie Canal pool below the Marsh Road Bridge.  At approximately 1:00 p.m., the COLONIAL BELLE navigated at slow bell on an easterly course under the center of the Marsh Road Bridge when the aft safety handrail allided with a steel I-beam on the bottom side of the Marsh Road Bridge.  \n\nThe Marsh Road Bridge did not sustain damage but the COLONIAL BELLE\u2019s starboard aft safety handrail was bent approximately 1\u201d down and several handrail welds broke.  The COLONIAL BELLE transited to their mooring without further incident and safely moored. \n\nThe Erie Canal water level for the pool in which the COLONIAL BELLE operated was 462.8 on the day of the incident.  At a maximum pool elevation of 463.00, the vertical clearance under the Marsh Road Bridge is 15.54' or 15' 6\".

{"activity_id":6857420,"brief":"In March 2019, PCL Civil Constructors, Inc. (PCL) and subcontractor Cherry Creek Recycling initiated a project to dismantle and demolish the existing 2-3 mile long Herbert C. Bonner Bridge (Bonner Bridge) spanning across Oregon Inlet. PCL utilized the deck barge U 210 (Official Number (O.N.) 1052577), the deck barge WEEKS 2220 (O.N. 1233586), the crane barge BR24072 (O.N. 553579), the towing vessel MISS BONNIE (O.N. 502796) and subcontracted various other towing vessels to haul the barges offshore and dispose of bridge pieces in designated artificial reef zones. \n\nOn Thursday, November 14, 2019, weather forecasts predicted a storm with wind gusts of approximately 50 knots in the Outer Banks over that weekend. In accordance with the Severe Weather & Hurricane Plan, the PCL Project Manager secured the U 210, WEEKS 2220, and BR24072 with an additional set of mooring lines to ten mooring pilings located approximately 400 feet east of the remaining superstructure of the Bonner Bridge. On November 16, 2019, a coastal storm started to get closer to the Outer Banks coastline and by Saturday evening into early Sunday the storm brought winds of up to 44 knots to the coast. On November 17, 2019, at approximately 0730 Eastern Standard Time (EST), sustained winds were 25-30 knots above what PCL Project Manager believed they would be, prompting him to direct a PCL employee to drive through the worksite to confirm all barges were moored to the pilings. The PCL employee confirmed they were. \n\nAt approximately 1000 EST, the North Carolina Department of Transportation called the PCL Project Manager to report that the U 210 and WEEKS 2220 had broken free and were adrift in Oregon Inlet. The PCL Project Manager then directed his employees to report to the worksite immediately to secure the adrift barges. At approximately 1030 EST, seven PCL employees arrived at the worksite and found both barges pinned up against the mooring pilings approximately two feet from the Bonner Bridge superstructure. The PCL crew decided to use the towing vessel MISS BONNIE, which was moored at the PCL dock on Pea Island, to recover the two barges. At approximately 1050 EST, MISS BONNIE got underway with seven persons onboard. As MISS BONNIE passed safely under the Marc Basnight Bridge (the new bridge that replaced the Bonner Bridge) and was getting closer to the pilings where the barges were pinned, the vessel ran aground on a shoal. The captain attempted to maneuver the vessel to free it from grounding, but was unsuccessful. After several attempts, the strong wind and current began to push MISS BONNIE toward the superstructure of the Bonner Bridge. As the vessel was pushed toward the bridge, the vessel slowly began to list to port and take on water over the port side gunwale. At approximately 1102 EST, the captain ordered the crew to abandon the vessel. All seven MISS BONNIE crewmembers climbed onto the superstructure of the bridge without entering the water and without suffering any injuries. At approximately 1130 EST, the MISS BONNIE capsized. The port side of the vessel rested on the ocean floor, while a portion of the starboard side was visible above water. While on the bridge, a PCL employee used a forklift to position a gangway from the bridge to each of the barges to secure the barges to the pilings. \n\nThe PCL Project Manager directed all crewmembers to undergo drug and alcohol testing in accordance with company procedures; however, these procedures did not meet Department of Transportation regulations. The Project Manager was not familiar with 46 CFR Part 4 requirements. This was their first marine casualty and he believed the company procedures would suffice. \n\nThe initiating event for this casualty was the parting of the mooring lines on the U 210 and the WEEKS 2220, which set both barges adrift. The barges then allided with the mooring pilings next to the Bonner Bridge. MISS BONNIE got underway in heavy weather to secure the barges, but grounded and then capsized while en route. The causal factors contributing to this casualty include: (1) PCL Project Manager failed to provide chafing protection on mooring lines, (2) the effect of the weather conditions on the barges due to a minimally protected mooring area, (3) PCL Project Manager failed to moor the barges at the south trestle dock, (4) unknown shoaling caused by rapid changes in water depth of Oregon Inlet, (5) inoperable echo depth sounder, (6) the 33 knot sustained winds and six knot flooding current caused MISS BONNIE to list to port, (7) the loss of stability due to seawater going over the gunwale, and (8) the loss of stability due to uncontrolled flooding."}

The NOAA recorded air draft was 43.3m, a 1 meter clearance. As the PRODIGY went under the bridge, the INMARSAT antenna made contact with the centerline bridge span, approximately 3 feet to the right of the channel lights. Damage onboard the vessel was a broken INMARSAT antenna and mount estimated at $10,000 to replace. Bridge owner (LADOTD) verified that there was no damage to the bridge due to this incident.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event for the casualty was the PRODIGY INMARSAT antenna striking the Huey P Long Bridge. The cause was the incorrect air draft stated on the pilot card (1.4 meters too low) which led to the Pilot recommending safe transit under the bridge with the belief the vessel had 1 meter of clearance. It is reasonable to believe that had the crew recorded the correct air draft on the pilot card, the Pilot would have known that the vessel had insufficient clearance and the Pilot could have required more ballast to be taken onboard to increase clearance under the bridge.\n\nThis incident met the criteria for a reportable marine casualty IAW 46 CFR 4.05-1 since the vessel allided with a bridge.

Additionally, the bridge's fendering system received damage estimated at approximately $55,000.\n\nDuring the investigation, it was identified that the relief master began his approach on an eastbound transit, contacted the Roosevelt Bridge operator for a bridge opening, cleared the Roosevelt Bridge and began adjusting his course for the second bridge, the Stuart FEC Railway Bridge, when a shift in current caused the vessel's port bow to react unexpectedly, giving the master no time to adjust. Following the temporary loss in maneuverability, the vessel's protruding trunnion guard allided with the bridge's north fendering system, causing the vessel to rebound towards the south fendering system, where the vessel rolled to starboard. Upon rolling to starboard, the vessel's life raft station protruded past the bridge's lifted bascule as the vessel continued forward momentum, at which point the life raft station allided with the bascule, leading to damage of the starboard side life raft station, hand rail, and running light. Following the second allision, the vessel rebounded a second time to port, where the vessel allided with the bridge's north fendering system a second time.\n\nThe Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the unexpected current leading to emergency maneuvering, followed by the bridge allision. The contributing factors were 1) the waterway hazards due to bridge restrictions, 2) the vessel's beam when compared to the horizontal clearance of the vessel, 3) the master's experience with the vessel in this particular waterway,  and 4) unexpected currents.\n\nAlthough the casualty only reached the level of a Data Collection, it was upgraded to an Informal to capture the waterway hazards on a vital waterway (Okeechobee Waterway) which cuts across the state of Florida."}
{"activity_id":6859785,"brief":"On November 09, 2019, at approximately 1526 (CST) the Inspected Towing Vessel STARFIRE (O.N. 261413) allided with the Cass Street Bridge on the Des Plaines River at MM 288.\n\nAs the Captain was steering the tow of 9 empty dry cargo barges southbound underneath the Cass Street Bridge a sudden gust of wind caused the ART 44009, which was positioned in the middle of the port string, to allide with the bridge pier. The Captain continued southbound, passing underneath the Jefferson Street Bridge. After clearing the Jefferson Street Bridge the Captain went astern to align the tow and allided the stern of the STARFIRE with the Jefferson Street Bridge. No report of any damage to the vessels or bridges.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was gusting winds negatively impacting the Captains ability to maintain control of the tow as it passed underneath the bridge followed by the Captain not maintaining a safe distance between the vessel and bridge when going astern to align the tow."}
{"activity_id":6859948,"brief":"On 24 September 2019 at approximately 2135 local time, the port lead barge in the 6 barge tow of the inspected towing vessel(ITV) SILAS JAMES allided with the fendering system of the BELLE CHASSE RR Bridge in the vicinity of mile marker 4 in the Intracoastal Waterway.\n\nThe SILAS JAMES was transiting westbound pushing 6 loaded rock barges with a destination of Cameron, LA. The Master stated as they made their approach to pass underneath the Belle Chasse Railroad Bridge, they lined up straight center and was transiting 2.5 kts. The Master said as they came closer to the bridge, the tow began to set towards the west bank of the canal. The Master tried to increase speed in order to correct their heading, however they were unsuccessful in doing so and the port lead barge hit the fendering system. \n\nDamage to the port lead barge (MEM 5040) was $55,687.50. After multiple attempts, the Coast Guard was unable to obtain an estimated damage cost for the Belle Chasse RR Bridge fendering system. The bridge owners confirmed the bridge was operational and safe for crossing.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the incident was a reportable Marine Casualty in accordance with 46 CFR Part 4. The level of investigation effort was a data collection as the damage was less than $75,000."}

The BLARNEY was traveling East in the Cerritos Channel when its satellite compass antenna struck the bridge. No damage was reported to the bridge.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the contact between the vessel\u2019s satellite compass antenna and the bridge, followed by the damage to the antenna. The causal factor that contributed to this casualty was the the Master's decision to pass under the bridge with insufficient overhead clearance."}
{"activity_id":6865411,"brief":"On 29Nov2019 Sector New York received notification of an allision between the hopper barge CMT RECTOR and the fendering system of the South Channel RR Bridge. The CMT Rector was unloaded and being pushed by the towing vessel CMT PIKE (O.N. 615367). Neither vessel is a USCG certificated vessel.\n\nThe CMT PIKE first attempted to pass through the bridge at approximately 1430 but was unable due to the wind conditions. The vessel attempted a 2nd pass at 1504. During the second attempt the wind, blowing at a speed of 20 knots from the NNW, pushed the STBD bow of the CMT RECTOR into the fendering system of the bridge. The fendering system was comprised of 20 pilings bound together by a metal wire and was pushed back, towards the bridge, approximately 3 feet. Neither the barge nor the towing vessel sustained any damage and there were no injuries."}
{"activity_id":6866544,"brief":"On November 23, 2019, at approximately 1600, Towing Vessel SOUTHERN BELLE was underway pushing six hopper barges loaded with rocks down bound on the Atchafalaya River near Melville, LA. As the vessel\u2019s Licensed Mate was setting up to transit through the railroad bridge, the current started to set the tow towards the east. The Mate attempted to steer against the set, but felt that the tow wasn't going to respond fast enough, so he started backing down and steering his flanking rudder to avoid or mitigate impact with the railroad bridge. At approximately 1604, the lead barge (SL 54) in the port string allided with east pier of the channel span. \n\nThe impact of the allision parted multiple tow wires, causing four of the six barges to break away from the tow. The bow void space of the SL 54 suffered extensive structural damage, subsequently causing the bow void space to flood to the river level. The Melville Railroad Bridge remained operational, with only superficial scratches noted in the concrete pillar of the east bridge span.\n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of barge SL 54 with the Melville Railroad Bridge, which caused extensive damage to the bow void of the barge.  The causal factors of this casualty include: (1) The vessel\u2019s Licensed Mate lacked experience navigating a tow downriver though the spans of the railroad bridge and (2) Unanticipated river current caused an uncontrollable slide toward the east span of the railroad bridge."}
{"activity_id":6866645,"brief":"On November 27, 2019, at approximately 0600, the ISLAND TRADER was pushing ahead crane barge STEVENS 1401 navigating northbound on the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway approaching the Wrightsville Beach Drawbridge. Approximately 1\/4-mile from the bridge, the master radioed the Bridge Tender to request an opening for northbound passage and continued transiting toward the bridge. At approximately 0610, the Bride Tender responded the master's request and opened the bridge for north bound passage. \n\nAfter the drawbridge span was opened, the master navigated the vessels in to the drawbridge channel entrance at approximately 1-knot. While entering the channel within the boundary of the drawbridge fender system, the towing vessel and barge were set to port by a flooding tidal current of approximately 3-knots. The master corrected with starboard rudder to prevent the STEVENS 1401 from alliding with the southwest dolphin and fender.  The STEVENS 1401 swung to starboard and the ISLAND TRADER's stern set to port and the towing vessel's port stern quarter allided with the southwest dolphin and fender system. \n\nThe vessel continued beneath the drawbridge span on a course toward the northeast fender. The master corrected with port rudder to prevent the STEVENS 1401 from alliding with the northeast fender. While in a port turn, the STEVENS 1401 starboard bow allided with the northeast fender.  After the allisions, the master increased underway speed, regained steerage control, and returned the vessels to the center of the channel. The master radioed the Bridge Tender and reported the vessel's allided with the drawbridge dolphin and fender systems and reported no damage sustained to the vessels. The master continued to navigate the vessels northbound en route Morehead City, NC. The Bridge Tender notified the Coast Guard of the allisions. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the ISLAND TRADER alliding with the Wrightsville Beach Drawbridge southwest dolphin and fender system, followed by, the STEVENS 1401 alliding with the northeast fender system. The casual factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) fast-moving flooding tidal current of approximately 3-knots, (2) the master's inability to safely maneuver the vessels in flooding tidal current waterway conditions to avoid alliding with the drawbridge dolphin and fender systems."}
{"activity_id":6869011,"brief":"On August 8, 2019 at about 01:15 CST, the UTV CAPTAIN SAM pulling astern empty deck barge MARMAC 301 had the starboard bow of barge MARMAC 301 lightly allide the Bayou Dularge Bridge Fender System.  This caused scuff marks to the barge and no damage to the bridge fender system.  Barge MARMAC 301 had a length of 300 feet long by 100 feet wide.  The Bayou Dularge Bridge span opening was only 125 feet wide.  \n\nThe allision occurred as the tow was underway east bound along the Gulf Intracoastal Water Way (GIWW) approaching MM 59.5 west of the Harvey Lock.  The tow got underway at 21:30 the previous evening from Mars Dock in Bayou Black, Louisiana and was heading to the Houma Navigational Canal; then, to the Cat Island Sea Buoy.  The UTV CAPTAIN SAM had the UTV CAPT MARK pushing MARMAC 301 astern; but, the master of the UTV CAPTAIN SAM had command of the entire tow.  A tow this size would have normally taken the Bayou Chene Route to the Gulf of Mexico and bypassed the narrow and congested GIWW in and around Houma, Louisiana.  But, due to high river levels in the Mississippi River and flooding threats to areas of South Louisiana, the Bayou Chene Route was closed to all marine traffic.  At about 01:00 CST, the tow made the bend that approached the Bayou Dularge Bridge; but, the tow sung out too wide.  There was not enough space or time for the tow to get realigned to the bridge span opening and that caused the starboard bow of the MARMAC 301 to lightly allide with the bridge fender system.  No damage was done the MARMAC 301 (other than scuffed paint) and no damage was reported by the bridge operator.  \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determine the initiating event was barge MARMAC 301 alliding the Bayou Dularge Bridge Fender System.  This caused no damage to barge MARMAC 301 (other than scuffed paint) and no damage to the bridge fender system.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:  1) The Bayou Chene Route was closed for larger tow configurations.  A large tow configuration of this size (being 300' long by 100' wide) normally would have bypassed the narrow and congested GIWW through Houma and taken Bayou Chene to the Gulf of Mexico and reentered the GIWW east of Houma.  But, due to the recent Hurricane Barry and local area flood risks, the Bayou Chene Route was shut-off to marine traffic.  2) The Bayou Dularge Bridge Span opening was only 125' wide and the tow width was 100' wide and 300' long.  This left little room for error to prevent the barge from alliding the bridge fender system.  3) Night time operations with near zero visibility made it difficult for the master properly assess collision\/allision risks."}

After arriving at the facility, the crew of JACK HOLLAND made the towing vessel up to the bow of the empty 297-foot gravel barge ATLAS THREE (O.N. 1269738) in order to push the barge backwards out of the Elizabeth River and up the James River to Richmond, Virginia. At approximately 1615 LMT, as the tug and barge were transiting north on the Southern Branch Elizabeth River, the starboard side of ATLAS THREE made contact with the east side fender system of the Gilmerton bridge. \n\nThe contact with the fender system did not cause any reported damage to the fender system or to the barge, and JACK HOLLAND and ATLAS THREE continued on the voyage to Richmond. A follow-up bridge survey by the City of Chesapeake determined that there was no damage to the Gilmerton bridge fender system. \n\nAs a result of the investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event was the contact between ATLAS THREE and the Gilmerton bridge fender system. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the weather conditions on the waterway, and (2) the constricted navigational area around the Gilmerton bridge. \n\nRecommend closing this incident investigation activity without a referral to an enforcement activity."}

The pilot onboard ordered several engine movements, the last being full astern, which the main engine did not respond to. The pilot onboard used the two assist tugs to maneuver and anchor the vessel. The engineer reported that the main engine exhaust valve spring airline connection was loose. The fitting for the exhaust valve spring airline connection was replaced and main engine tested ahead and astern with proper operation of the main engine at approximately 0602. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was when the compression olive failed in the fitting for the main engine exhaust valve spring airline connection and resulted in a reduction in air pressure that subsequently led to the loss of propulsion. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty were the vibration of the fitting due to normal vessel operation and the material failure of the compression olive in the fitting."}

The Ohio River water levels IVO the entrance to the Portland Canal were dropping and a strong out draft had developed towards McAlpine Dam.  At approx. 04:15 local time the ITV WILLIAM P MORELLI was IVO Six Mile Island at mile 598 Ohio River when the Master made radio contact with the operator of the L & I Railroad Bridge located at 604.5 Ohio River to arrange for transit underneath.  The bridge was about to lower down due to a train due to cross but the bridge operator stated the bridge would be up by the time the ITV WILLIAM P MORELLI needed to pass underneath.  As the ITV and barges got closer to the railroad bridge the Master of the ITV WILLIAM P MORELLI observed the train on the railroad bridge taking longer than anticipated to clear and attempted to slow the vessel's approach towards the railroad bridge.  After slowing the approach to the railroad bridge the Master became aware of the out draft pulling the tow towards McAlpine Dam and the dike located on the Portland Canal entrance RDB so he went full ahead to counter the out draft.  Once the tow was inside the Portland Canal the Master attempted to back down to swing the head of the tow to starboard but it was too late to avoid hitting the Portland Canal wall with the port lead barge. The port lead barge of the tow, ING 7593 allided with the LDB of the Portland Canal wall tearing open the bow void and the damaging the #1 void.  The bow rake of the ING 7593 and #1 void flooded to river level.  The force of the tow allision with the Portland Canal wall resulted in 14 of the 15 barges in the tow breaking loose.  11 of the breakaway barges remained in the Portland Canal while 3 of the breakaway barges, (IN005000, T13908, and IN116519) drifted over the dike at the entrance to the Portland Canal towards McAlpine Dam.  Two barges, the ING 4910 and IN 065460, in the tow were damaged during the breakaway but remained seaworthy.  The Master of the ITV WILLIAM P MORELLI took the ITV over the dike at the entrance to Portland Canal to retrieve the breakaway barges, IN005000, T13908, and IN116519 before they could hit McAlpine Dam.  The cargo of wood chips in hopper barge ING 7953 was partially offloaded to another barge to raise the bow rake damage out of the water so the barge could safely transit to a facility to be completely offloaded before transiting to a shipyard for repairs. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the ING 7593 allision with the LDB of the Portland Canal wall, due to a strong out draft towards McAlpine Dam IVO the entrance to the Portland Canal, combined with the need for the ITV WILLIAM P MORELLI to slow vessel speed before entering the Portland Canal in order to wait for the railroad bridge to raise.

The operator navigated the vessel with the main sail and jib unfurled, but under primary propulsion of the main engine.  The vessel  transited upon the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (AICW) on a southerly course toward the Cape Fear River via Snow's Cut during high tide.  At approx. 1030, the vessel approached the AICW US Highway 421 Carolina Beach Rd. Bridge, also known as, Snow's Cut Bridge.  The vessel was transiting at approx. 2-knots when it passed under the bridge span at the center of the navigable channel.  While transiting below the bridge, the vessel's weather antenna mounted atop the main mast struck the center channel navigation light suspended beneath the bridge span. \n\nThe navigation light broke from its mounted position and plunged into the water adjacent to the vessel's stern.  The operator realized what occurred, terminated the voyage, and turned the vessel around on a northerly course.  The vessel transited under the bridge a second time without further incident and returned to Carolina Beach Boat Basin where it was safely moored.  The operator and passenger notified the owner of the incident and departed the vessel. A Good Samaritan witness and the North Carolina Department of Transportation notified the Coast Guard of the vessel's mast alliding and damaging the bridge channel aid to navigation light. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event for this casualty was the SAPRTAN II\u2019s equipment mounted atop the main mast struck the Snow\u2019s Cut Bridge center channel navigation light.

The Master was in the process of navigating the left descending span of the Hannibal Railroad Drawbridge when the tow got set off towards the left descending bank (LDB) of the river. Because the Master misjudged the river conditions, it caused the head of the tow to put them on track to allide with the upstream bridge pier for the Broadway Ave Hwy Bridge. In an effort to avoid the allision, the Master turned the tow to starboard. Because of this abrupt maneuver and with the tow now somewhat perpendicular to the river current, the tow began to top around. In an effort to avoid the tow from coming completely topping around and possibly alliding with the downriver bridge (Hannibal Railroad Drawbridge) the Master came ahead on the ITV and intentionally grounded the tow on a sandbar along the LDB just outside of the channel.

The uninspected towing vessel LITTLE MARY (Official Number 1235276) was also assisting with the towing evolution. The observed weather conditions were clear skies, with 10-12 knot winds from the west, and an ebbing tide. A Virginia State Pilot was hired for the towing evolution. The Pilot discussed the bridge transit with the Masters of the towing vessels. He then proceeded to stand on the starboard bow of the JMC 256. He directed the SEA COAST to lay flat along the port bow without a line. The LITTLE MARY was directed to lay along the port quarter of the JMC 256. The Master of the SEA COAST positioned a lookout on the port side outside of the wheelhouse. As the lookout called out distances, the Master of the SEA COAST relayed the distances to the Pilot standing on the barge. As they began to exit along the South side of the bridge span, the stern of the SEA COAST allided with the southeast fender of the Gilmerton Bridge. A four foot rubber panel fell off the fender. A representative from the City of Chesapeake visited the bridge and assessed the total cost for the damages at $3,000.00.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event was the bridge allision.

As the tow entered a bend near mile marker 246, the Captain began steering to port but noticed the rudder indicator showed the rudder hard to starboard.  The Captain switched to the backup steering pump with no change.  Steering was switched to non-follow-up and the rudder responded properly.  However, due to high water conditions, oncoming current, and the steering loss the tow continued to drift and eventually the head of the tow struck the bank.  After the head of the tow struck the bank, nine of the 15 barges broke free and drifted down the river.  \n\nFollowing the casualty, the Captain examined the steering system and found that the follow-up steering shaft manual limit pin was missing.  This pin was replaced on-scene and all steering capabilities returned to the vessel.  The CAPT. W.D. NUNLEY then proceeded to gather the barges that had broken free without further incident.  \n\nAfter the barges broke free, the CAPT. W.D. NUNLEY began the process of retrieving its barges.  It was reported some of the barges drifted approximately 10 miles downriver until secured.   Several Good Samaritan vessels assisted in securing the barges.  It was reported that one barge struck the Pomeroy-Mason Bridge near mile marker 251.3.  Due to darkness, no one physically saw the barge make contact, but heard what sounded like something hitting the bridge.  Two property owners in Pomeroy, OH, area reported minor damage to their property from the drifting barges.\n  \nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the loss of steering due to the pin falling out of the follow-up steering shaft manual limit.  This caused the tow to subsequently strike the bank and nine of the 15 barges to break free.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty are:\n\n1. A cotter pin that was supposed to hold the missing pin in place apparently failed causing the pin to fall out.  However, the CAPT. W.D. NUNLEY had been on its current voyage for approximately four days without any known incidents.  The company immediately conducted verification checks on all vessels with similar steering systems to ensure the pins were properly in place and secure.  In addition, the company instituted policy changes for crews to conduct routine checks of the pin on all vessels with similar systems.\n\nThere were no injuries, pollution, or other damage.

The vessel suffered minor damage to its canopy framing. The bridge was undamaged. No passengers were onboard at the time and no injuries to the crew occurred. No pollution or other incident resulted from this casualty.\n\nThe TIKI BARGE I had finished re-fueling at Channel Park Marina at approximately 09:19 a.m. EST and was underway heading down-bound on the Old River, a channel of the Cuyahoga River, intending to moor at the Christies dock to take on passengers for a scheduled excursion at 10:00 a.m. EST. The vessel proceeded under good weather conditions with unlimited visibility and a light breeze. While heading towards the Cuyahoga River, the mate noticed a log in the river and advised the master to avoid it, who did so successfully. Soon after the vessel approached the Willow Street Bridge that spans the Old River; the bridge was in the down position. The Willow Street Bridge is a lift bridge with a clearance of 12 feet when down as measured from the low water datum. The master asked the mate, who was stationed near the bow, if the vessel had enough clearance to proceed under the bridge. At the time of the casualty the water level was 5.3 feet above the low water datum and the vessel's air-draft was approximately 10.5 feet. The mate misunderstood and thought the master was asking if the vessel had cleared the log and replied \"yes.\" The vessel proceeded under the bridge, but did not actually have enough clearance, resulting in the vessel's canopy hitting the underside of the bridge. After impact, the master immediately reversed the vessel's engines and extracted the vessel out from under the bridge. The impact left the bridge undamaged, but caused minor damage to the vessel's canopy. The damage to the canopy did not require immediate repair and the vessel was permitted by the Coast Guard marine inspector to continue operations. \n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was TIKI BARGE I striking the Willow Street bridge. The causal & human factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the lack of effective communication that led to the mate misunderstanding the question from the vessel's master, (2) the attempt to cross under the lift bridge without adequate air-draft; and (3) lack of proper voyage planning to determine the vessel's ability to cross under the bridge."}

Recreational vessel LA 2627 GH pushed the UNNAMED DECK BARGE through the canal. During the transit, Employee 1 was onboard the excavator, and Employees 2 and 3 were onboard LA 2627 GH. Cajun Way Marine Solutions LLC owned and operated the LA 2627 GH, excavator, and barge. This company performed residential pier construction on the Eden Isle Canal.\n\nAt 0930 the employees prepared to conduct a construction operation located on the north side of the canal. To reach the new construction site, the UNNAMED DECK BARGE and excavator would need to pass under the Eden Isle Canal Bridge. Employees 2 and 3 remained onboard LA 2627 GH, moving the deck barge toward the Eden Isle Canal Bridge. Employee 1 remained onboard the deck barge in the operator's cabin of the excavator. As the barge and excavator approached the bridge, Employee 1 was in the excavator\u2019s cab driving it closer to the bow of the barge in order to shift the weight of the excavator forward decreasing the freeboard of the barge to allow the excavator to pass freely under the bridge. As the barge attempted to pass under the bridge through bents #2 and #3, the top of the excavator made contact with the bottom of the bridge. After unsuccessfully transiting under the bridge, Employee 1 once again shifted the excavator forward to reduce the forward freeboard of the barge. The forward weight shift of the excavator caused the uncontrollable submersion of the bow, thereby capsizing the barge. Employee 1 entered the water and was pinned between the capsized barge and bridge bent #2. After capsizing, the barge began to sink, ultimately settling on the canal bottom partially submerged on its side. The excavator sank as well, completely submerged. An unknown amount and specific petroleum-based substance entered the water from the excavator. Two days later, on June 27, 2020, Employee 1 was pronounced dead from the injuries sustained while in the water.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event of this marine casualty was the bridge allision. Following the allision, the UNNAMED DECK BARGE flooded, the barge capsized, Employee 1 entered the water, the barge and excavator sank, the excavator discharged pollution, and Employee 1 ultimately died from injuries sustained during the incident. The causal factors include a lack of established operational culture and the overreliance on heuristic reasoning."}

{"activity_id":7026333,"brief":"On August 3, 2020 AP Construction had two barges, DEVIN a spud barge and a construction barge, located in the Schuylkill River by the CSX Bridge. Tropical Storm Isaias was set to hit on August 4, 2020 and the company took measures to secure the DEVIN and the construction barge. The foreman on board the DEVIN on August 3rd and the manager of the operation. The manager checked the weather on August 3rd and instructed the foreman to secure iron and loose objects onboard the DEVIN and the construction barge. The foreman reseated the 70 ft. spuds and were approximately 40 ft. into the Schuylkill. The foreman then added additional lines from the DEVIN to the material barge to secure it.\n\nDuring the storm the DEVIN was moored on the west side of the Schuylkill with the material barge on the starboard side. The spuds had a material failure and bent, causing the DEVIN and material barge to drift towards the CSX bridge. Eventually the DEVIN would allided with the CSX Bridge. The DEVIN struck the fendering system of the CSX Bridge with the bow rake. A majority of the damage was sustained with the spuds, with the port aft spud creating a hole in the stern box.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the the material failure of the spuds. This was followed by the eventual allision. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) Tropical Storm Isaias caused a surge of debris in the Schuylkill river. This storm caused a record surge in the Schuylkill river with the amount of debris and water causing additional weight on the DEVIN spuds, (2) AP Construction did not have a proper SMS\/Policy\/Procedures in place in regards to heavy weather, maintenance, or daily tasking. Had the company created SOP\/Policies in writing for managers\/employees to follow, they could have been more prepared for the storm, (3) Prior to Tropical Storm Isaias the managers from AP construction made the decision to utilize all four spuds on the DEVIN. In addition, they tied off the material barge to the stbrd side with additional line. This was a causal factor because the additional weight of the construction barge plus the additional weight of water and debris created additional weight that exceeded the spuds strength. (4) For previous storms, using all four spuds were proven to be efficient during heavy weather. However, during Tropical Storm Isaias this plan was proved to be faulty. Had the managers of the company conducted a thorough heavy weather plan they would have been better equipped to avoid the material failure."}

The Coast Guard Investigating Officer spoke with the bridge tender via phone and no clear explanation was given as to why the lift bridge was lowered before the tow cleared the bridge, except that it was a mistake or misunderstanding.  The bridge is located along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway at mile marker 35.6 west of the Harvey Locks.  It is a Louisiana State Bridge.\n\nThe vessel's mast pole was damaged after being impacted from above by the lowering bridge.  The UTV LAROSE had an air space or height of about 47 feet from the waterline to the very top of the highest antenna.  The West Larose Lift Bridge height is 37 feet above the water's surface in the down position and in the raised position is 70 feet above the water's surface.  The bridge was opened all the way when the tow was \u00bc mile from the bridge span.  After both leading barges cleared the span, but just before the UTV LAROSE was immediately under the span, the bridge tinder wrongfully lowered the bridge onto the UTV LAROSE causing the incident.  As the vessel\u2019s wheelhouse was directly below the lowering bridge, from the master's view, the master could not tell that the bridge was lowering onto the vessel until he felt the impact from above.   Following the incident, the vessel proceeded to Main Iron Works in Houma, Louisiana, near MM 50 of the Gulf Intracoastal Canal Waterway for repair.  U. S. Coast Guard District 8 Bridges Division was notified.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the bridge operator wrongfully lowered the bridge before the tow cleared the bridge span opening.  This caused the bridge to hit and damage the UTV LAROSE's mast pole.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:  (1) Poor communication between the bridge tender and the vessel's master as the master thanked the bridge tender via Channel 13 before his vessel cleared the span.  The master thanked the bridge tender too early and the bridge tender began to lower the bridge after being thanked; (2) Failure of the bridge tender to visually verify that the entire tow cleared the bridge span before lowing the bridge onto the vessel.  To help prevent a reoccurrence, it is suggested vessels designate a lift bridge lookout to notify the master immediately if the bridge is mistakenly lowered onto the vessel's wheel house.  Due to restricted overhead view from the wheelhouse, the master didn't notice the bridge lowering until the first impact.  Consider, had the bridge tender started to lower the bridge seconds earlier or if the tow was moving a \u00bc mile slower, the vessel's wheel house could have been impacted and this casualty could have been a lot worse."}
{"activity_id":7066589,"brief":"At approximately 1530 on September 3, 2020, the towing vessel CHALLENGER (O.N. 635043) was towing the loaded deck barge JMC-150 (O.N. 1136586) astern when the deck barge allided with the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel. The CHALLENGER and barge approached the section of the bridge near Fisherman's Island heading east, the mate reduced the vessel's speed to clutch ahead to allow the nearby fishing vessel RAPPAHANNOCK to cross ahead first. As the CHALLENGER then regained speed and passed under the bridge, the starboard bow of the barge allided with the fender system on the bridge. A section of the fender broke off and fell onto the deck of the barge. The total estimated cost of damage to the bridge was $486,400. There was no reported damage to the barge.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of the deck barge JMC-150 with the fender of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) Weather conditions impact on barge movement; and (2) Planning error by the mate of the CHALLENGER."}
{"activity_id":7067287,"brief":"On September 27, 2020, at approximately 1935 CST, the containership SATURN, under the control of a Houston Pilot, allided with the Sidney Sherman (Interstate 610) Bridge while transiting inbound for City Dock 21 in Houston, Texas. The Houston Ship Channel (HSC)  is marked by lights, lighted ranges, buoys, and day beacons, with several large vehicle bridges spanning the waterway. The Interstate 610 Bridge is located near the terminus of the HSC.  SATURN is a 529-foot, 16,162 gross-ton motor vessel with two self-service cranes onboard. \n\nAs indicated on SATURN's \"General Arrangement\" plan, the vessel's maximum height from the bottom of the keel to the top of the mast was 147.99 ft. This figure is listed on and used in the pilot card, ships particulars, loading computer program, and the \"wheelhouse poster\" on the bridge. The master and chief mate trusted the accuracy of this information and used it to calculate SATURN's air draft before transiting to City Dock 21. The SATURN's officers calculated the air draft at 127.78 feet which was satisfactory since the listed clearance height of the 610 bridge is 135 feet, giving the SATURN more than 7 feet of clearance, theoretically. \n\nUnfortunately, the SATURN struck the underside of the 610 bridge while attempting to transit beneath it, destroying her anchor light and an INMARSAT-c antenna. After analyzing both SATURN's \"navigational lights and masthead\" plan and measuring the height of the mast by hand,  the crew determined that the listed height of 147.99 feet in the \"General Arrangement\" was inaccurate. The actual overall height of the vessel was determined to be 157.48 ft. Consequently, with the vessel's aft draft of 20.34 feet, SATURN's air draft was actually 137.14 feet, more than 2 feet taller than the required clearance height. It's uncertain why SATURN's overall height on the \"General Arrangement\" plan was inaccurate. However, both the master and chief mate are correcting all inaccurate air draft postings and notifying the company\/owner of the issue to thwart additional bridge allisions from taking place. \n\nThe Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the inaccurate overall vessel height on the SATURN's plans used to calculate her air draft."}

{"activity_id":7075692,"brief":"On September 24, 2020 at approximately 1212 (LMT), the Coast Guard was notified of an allision between the uninspected deck barge HENRY S being pushed by the towing vessel MS MONIQUE and the Bayou Boeuf Bridge in Amelia, LA.  The vessel did not make this notification, but the bridge tender called VTS.  The MS MONIQUE was transiting northbound pushing the crane barge at an angle approaching the channel and did not straighten before entering the channel of the bridge.  The resulting outcome was the barge bouncing off the fendering system three times.  The port bow of the barge first came into contact with the southeast center fender system before hitting the starboard center of the barge on the southeast approach fender system and then finally coming into contact with northeast center fender system with the port bow of the barge.  There was report of damage to the Bayou Boeuf fendering system.  \n\nInspectors responded to the MS MONIQUE to inspect the barge and towing vessel for damages.  No damage was found to the barge.  However, after inspectors walked around on the towing vessel several serious deficiencies were found.  A flag state detention was issued to the MS MONIQUE.  \n\nAt the time of this casualty, the only MSU Morgan City Investigating Officer (IO) was conducting another casualty investigation that occurred earlier that day.  Duty inspectors responded to the MS MONIQUE bridge allision on behalf of the IO.  Since that time, Coast Guard IOs have made numerous attempts to obtain more information regarding the casualty and personnel onboard.

{"activity_id":7081322,"brief":"At approximately 0115 ChST on October 18, 2020, towing vessel HURAO suffered a full loss of propulsion. The casualty occurred as the HURAO was assisting with the undocking of the foreign tank vessel TUCHKOV BRIDGE. At the time of the incident, the HURAO was positioned and pushing ahead on the tanker's starboard quarter with no lines attached, keeping the vessel pinned against the F-2 dock in Inner Apra Harbor, Guam. \n\nAccording to the Master's report, the emergency fuel shut off valves for the HURAO's main diesel engines were inadvertently left in the off position following some earlier maintenance completed by the vessel's engineers. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the unintended shutdown of the port main diesel engine resulting in a reduction in the vessel's maneuverability. This was followed by the unintended shutdown of the vessel's starboard main diesel engine and full loss of propulsion. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) a failure on the part of the vessel's engineers to re-open the emergency fuel shut off valves for the main diesel engines following completion of maintenance and (2) the exhaustion of the residual fuel supply located in the supply piping between the emergency fuel shutoff valve and the engines' fuel injectors.\n\nIAW ALCOAST 100\/20 , this investigation has been downgraded to a data collection."}

Vessel transited with low sulfur marine gas oil (LSMGO) fed from the service tank to supply both generators and the main diesel engine. At approximately 0810PST, the attending engineer took unprompted action to \"top up\" the MGO service tank with contents collected in the overflow tank. The overflow tank can be cross connected with the fuel settling and storage tanks that collect fuel oil from the main diesel engine and ship service generator fuel returns lines, MGO settling and storage tanks.\n\nThe vessel continued its transit outbound on the Columbia River near Astoria, Oregon at full ahead speed when the pilot and master noticed a reduction in main diesel engine RPMs and a subsequent reduction in speed at 0840PST, thirty minutes after the fuel tank was topped up. At 0852PST, the vessel experienced a total power failure, resulting in a loss of propulsion and loss of steering. The engineers attempted to bring the propulsion plant back online. Without any immediate knowledge of what caused the loss of power and without an estimated time of when the power would return, the pilot gave orders to drop the anchors in an attempt to slow the fully loaded cargo vessel and get it outside of the channel to avoid collision with other deep draft traffic. At 0855 starboard anchor was let go. At 0857 the port anchor was let go to bring the vessel to a complete stop outside of the navigational channel. The pilot made notification to the USCG that the vessel suffered a total loss of power. \nAt 0930, the vessel's starboard side of the bow swung soft aground outside the channel in the vicinity of Jetty Lagoon (Buoy 25) as a result of the outgoing tide. Crewmembers surveyed tanks and voids and confirmed no water ingress or compromise of watertight integrity. At 0950, a COTP Order was issued requiring the vessel to provide reason for loss of power, verify repairs were made to the satisfaction of class and USCG, and to conduct an underwater dive survey. Assist tugs were ordered alongside to unfoul the anchors and attempt to free the soft aground vessel. \n\nAt 1315PST, the incoming tide freed the bow of the vessel. Further inspection confirmed no water ingress, and vessel tug SAMANTHA S moved the vessel north, outside the channel to avoid impact from future tidal changes. At 1610PST, it was reported that the starboard anchor broke free and with it four shots of chain as the assist tugs attempted to unfoul the anchors. Three assist tugs were still alongside and the port anchor was still holding. The channel was restricted to a 30 foot draft until successful recovery of the anchor by a salvage company.         \n\n\nOn 23 October 2020, RINA Class surveyor determined that the loss of power was due to fuel contamination. While in transit, the crew transferred fuel from the overflow tank to the service tank. The fuel contained water contaminants and did not properly drain or filter out before being consumed by the main engine and generators. A complete transfer of fuel was conducted and the service tank was cleaned, tested, and all filtration system components examined. Satisfactory tests were run and the COTP Order was lifted and vessel continued on its transit.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the contaminated fuel, and lack of procedure for tank to tank fuel transfer while in a restricted maneuverability underway in a dynamic river system river systems contributed to the total loss of power, and subsequent grounding."}

The weather was clear and sunny and the wind was gusting upward of 20 MPH in a north-east direction. The wind was pushing the barge toward the dock. The employees at Luck Stone Terminal were unloading gravel from the barge and maneuvering it using mooring lines and an excavator from the dock. Two Luck Stone employees were handling the mooring lines from the barge and one was operating the excavator.  The employees on the barge released all mooring lines in order to allow the excavator to move the barge using the bucket and arm. The excavator moved the barge forward along the dock, ending up with its bow past the dock and its stern at the middle of the dock. Once the barge was moved, a single mooring line from a dolphin was wrapped around a cleat on the barge three times, in a figure eight configuration. A gust of wind changed direction to north-west direction, and pushed the vessel's bow away from the dock, causing the excavator to lose control of the barge and the mooring line to unravel from the cleat. The barge was set adrift northbound with both employees on board. The vessel struck the Norfolk Southern #7 Railroad Bridge on the east side of the channel. The barge was tied off at that location by the employees on board until it was recovered by a Good Samaritan towing vessel. \n\nA vessel surveyor estimated the damage to the barge to be $8,000.

{"activity_id":7100455,"brief":"On 22 November 2020 at approximately 2122 CST, the tow of the inspected towing vessel (ITV) TRENT JOSEPH (U.S. Flag, O.N. 1055480, 67') allided with the Leo Kerner (Barataria) swing bridge, located at mile marker 36 on Bayou Barataria. The vessel was transiting southbound on the waterway toward Barataria Bay with the cement barge KS 4513 (U.S. Flag, O.N. 1228278) and crane barge JMSS MOBILE (U.S. Flag, O.N. 1206509) in stern tow and the ITV GEORGE C (U.S. Flag, O.N. 1237510) as the tail boat. Following the allision, the bridge was damaged and knocked from its gear pedestal, and the waterway was closed to traffic. No significant damage was reported to any of the involved vessels. No injuries or pollution were reported.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event was the over-rotation of the Leo Kerner swing bridge. The bridge was normally in the closed position and only opened when a vessel needed to transit the channel. The bridge was opened by the bridge tender at the request of the TRENT JOSEPH's master, however the bridge over-rotated by approximately 30 inches which impinged on the navigable portion of the waterway and the required navigation lighting was missing from the east fender system. As a result of the master's inability to see navigation lights on the east fender, he contacted the bridge tender to confirm the tow must pass east of the span. The bridge tender confirmed passing to the east side of the span and suggested using the vessel spotlights to light the fenders. The master did so, but could not see the bridge structure until the vessel was approximately 100 feet from the bridge. As a result, the TRENT JOSEPH steered closer to the visible lighting on the bridge span and the aft port corner of the JMSS MOBILE made contact with the end corner of the horizontal girder and deck planks of the over-rotated bridge.\n\nDrug and alcohol testing of the master and deckhand of the TRENT JOSEPH was conducted following the incident and determined not a factor in the allision. A 96-hour work\/rest history was not conducted. The Coast Guard Investigator deemed that work\/rest was not a causative or potential factor in the allision.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the incident met the reportable marine casualty criteria in 46 CFR 4.05-1.

{"activity_id":7100978,"brief":"On August 31, 2020, at approximately 8:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, the uninspected towing vessel MISS SHEILA, which is operated by Demex Construction Services, was underway on the Black River in Lorain, OH outbound to Lake Erie with the deck barge ANCHOR DAY in tow when a spud on the barge struck the Erie Ave Bridge (locally known as the Charles Berry Bridge).  Approximately ten minutes prior to the casualty, the master of the towing vessel called for a bridge tender for an opening, the tender was only able to open the East side of the bridge but kept the west side down because an inspection was occurring for the bridge. Once the East side of the bridge was opened, the master of the towing vessel attempted the transit, but due to the angle of the barge on the transit the aft port-side spud struck the bridge. No structural damage occurred to the bridge or the barge. The bridge suffered chipped paint, after being recently re-painted. No injuries, pollution or other incident occurred as a result of this casualty.\n\nThe barge is outfitted with four spuds (long steel bars) at each corner of the barge that when lowered are used to hold the barge in place and thus anchoring the barge to the lake bottom allowing a stable work platform. The spuds stand at approximately 15 feet above the deck when fully retracted. The barge normally operates with the spuds fully retracted and will typically only lower the spuds when at the construction site. The barge had approximately 17 feet of air draft at the time of the casualty. \n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the striking of the bridge by the aft port-side spud. The causal and human factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the master of the towing vessel failing to wait for a full bridge lift instead of attempting to transit with only a partial lift, (2) the master of the towing vessel misjudging the angle the barge would need to clear the bridge ; and (3) the height of the spuds above the barge heightened the air-draft and thus increased the likelihood of striking the bridge."}
{"activity_id":7101629,"brief":"On November 24, 2020 at approximately 0310, M\/V SEATTLE BRIDGE (ON 9560352) was southbound in Puget Sound west of Browns Point at 5 knots, when the vessel experienced a loss of propulsion.  At approximately 0246 the vessel\u2019s low fuel pressure alarm activated as the fuel pressure dropped from 6.3 to 5.0 bar.  The vessel then immediately changed fuel pumps, however they found no improvement and the pressure continued to drop. Eventually the vessel secured the engine at 0310. Upon investigation it was found that there was air in the main engine fuel supply line. The air was introduced as the result of a faulty valve seal.  The valve was closed properly, the air was bleed from the fuel system. Propulsion was regained at 0335 and the vessel moored safely at Washington United Terminal, Tacoma at 0548. \n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was steam valve not being secured properly thus allowing air to be introduced into the fuel system causing the fuel pressure drop.  The causative factor that contributed to this casualty was a failure to properly operate equipment."}
{"activity_id":7103577,"brief":"At approximately 0800 LMT, on November 29, 2020, the inspected towing vessel DEFENDER (ON: 651977) was towing astern an anchor barge, a pontoon barge and 700 feet of dredge pipe, southbound on the Elizabeth River. The DEFENDER was headed toward the Gilmerton Bridge. The uninspected towing vessel THUNDER (ON: 1236320) assisted the tow on the port side near the middle of the dredge pipe section. The inspected towing vessel BOBBIE ANN (ON: 510349) assisted the tow from the stern of the dredge pipe section. The master of the DEFENDER directed his deckhand to serve as a lookout on the bridge for the tow aft of the vessel. The master of the DEFENDER was also in radio communications with the masters of the other two vessels via VHF. The weather was clear and sunny with no wind. The tide had just passed slack tide and was ebbing in a north-west direction.\n\nAs the master of the DEFENDER prepared to transit through the Gilmerton Bridge, he made a right-hand turn. The master navigated the vessel just right of the center of the channel to avoid having the ebb set the tow to port. The THUNDER was positioned on the outside of the turn, pushing the dredge pipe to the inside in order to avoid an allision with the east fender. The master of the BOBBIE ANN was pushing the stern of the dredge pipe to the outside of the turn, guiding it toward the middle of the channel. As the master of the THUNDER pushed the dredge pipe, it pivoted along the point of contact and the front section of the dredge pipe swung to starboard, pushing the pontoon barge in the same direction. The deckhand was talking with the master, and failed to notice the pontoon barge approaching the bridge fender. The master of the DEFENDER was focused ahead of the vessel and advised the deckhand that he could not train him at that time. The master of the BOBBIE ANN notified the master of the DEFENDER via VHF that the tow was looking good, referring to the stern of the tow. The master of the DEFENDER understood it to mean that the tow was clearing the bridge on all points and continued ahead.\n\nAt approximately 0934 LMT on November 29, 2020, the barges in the tow allided with the Gilmerton Bridge west bank fender scraping the surface of the rubber, resulting in $164 worth of damage. The master of the DEFENDER notified Sector Virginia Command Center and submitted form CG-2692, Report of Marine Casualty. \n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of the uninspected barges with the Gilmerton Bridge. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) Excessive force applied to tow by assist tug; (2) Inattention error \u2013 deckhand was distracted and failed to observe the tow; (3) Inattention error - master failed to ensure lookout was attentive; and (4) Communication error \u2013 wrong interpretation of assist vessel master communication.\n\nRecommend closing this incident investigation activity with a referral for enforcement."}

{"activity_id":7104477,"brief":"On June 27, 2020 at about 22:30 CST, the Towing Vessel AFFIRMED pushing ahead six loaded salt barges (2 wide by 3 long) had the port bow of the tow's lead port barge allide with the Bayou Dularge Bridge Fender System, causing damage to barge MEM 2144.  Barge MEM 2144 suffered damage to the port bow rake.  Neither the bridge nor the other vessels in the tow reported damage.  The tow size was 2 barges wide by 3 barges long making the tow width at about 70 feet wide by 600 feet long.  The Bayou Dularge Bridge span opening is 125 feet wide. \n\nThe allision occurred at night with near zero visibility while the Towing Vessel AFFIRMED was underway east bound along the Gulf Intracoastal Water Way (GIWW) approaching MM 59.5 west of the Harvey Lock.  The tow got underway from Avery Island Salt Mine heading to MM 107 on the Lower Mississippi River.  While proceeding at about 2.5 mph, the tow's lead port barge allided the bridge's fender system causing  damage to salt barge MEM 2144.  All six barges broke free in two strings, with 3 barges per string.  The two barge strings were retrieved.  \n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event was barge MEM 2144 alliding the port side bridge fender system.  This caused heavy damage to barge MEM 2144's port bow.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:  1) The vessel\u2019s master failed to adequately navigate his vessel and tow to prevent the tow\u2019s port lead barge, MEM 2144, from alliding the Bayou Dularge Bridge Fender System, 2) there was minimal visibility at night.

{"activity_id":7106389,"brief":"On November 7, 2020 at approximately 1618 (LMT), the Coast Guard was notified of an allision between the uninspected deck barge (SPC 0231) being pushed by the ITV LITTLE BOB (O.N. 633672) and the Bayou Boeuf Bridge fender.  The SPC 0231 was loaded with an equipment crane and its port bow rubbed against the South East center fender system on the approach under the bridge.  The ITV LITTLE BOB entered the channel at an angle, traveling close to the wall which caused the barge to rub against the fender and damage the boards and bracing.  There was no report of any damages to the actual bridge, barge, or towing vessel.  There was no pollution or injuries.  The total cost of damage to the fendering system is inconclusive as there was damage already present from a prior allision.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the SPC 0231 and the Bayou Boeuf Railroad Bridge.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: \n(1) The angled approach of the ITV LITTLE BOB and SPC 0231 upon entering the channel to go under the Bayou Boeuf Railroad Bridge."}

{"activity_id":7111325,"brief":"At approximately 1020 LMT on December 12, 2020 the tug SHANNON DAN (O.N. 531906) and the barge 460012 (CG1433122) were transiting the Elizabeth River at 3.9 knots with the barge in a side tow configuration. As the tow was going through the Gilmerton Bridge it started \u201ccrabbing\u201d to the port side which resulted in an allision with the fendering system. As the barge struck the fendering system, it bounced off and continued transiting through the bridge span when it struck the fendering system a second time. The SHANNON DAN did not make contact with the bridge. The Master notified the Coast Guard following the marine casualty and although the incident did not reach the threshold for a serious marine incident, he conducted post casualty alcohol test.   \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the inadequate vessel maneuvering of the SHANNON DANN during the transit through the bridge fendering system. The subsequent event was the barge 460012 allision with the Gilmerton Bridge fendering system. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) execution error\/attention failure: mariner failed to take early and substantial action to avoid allision with the bridge fendering system by incorrectly factoring in the current, width of bridge span and dimensions of the side tow to safely transit through without an allision (2) environmental complexity: the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River has multiple bends when approaching from the north of the Gilmerton Bridge. These angles and natural bends in the river make navigating this bridge and waterway complex, and (3) the original construction of the bridge in 1938 did not consider the expansive commercial vessel traffic that would transit the waterway. \n\nRecommend closing this incident investigation activity with a referral to an enforcement activity."}

{"activity_id":7114646,"brief":"On December 17, 2020, at approximately 0905 EST, the towing vessel GRACE MYRICK (O.N. 561160) was underway on the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) while pushing ahead two uninspected barges, the STEVENS 1601 (O.N. 296301) and the MYRICK 13060 (O.N. 1276753) loaded with miscellaneous deck cargo when the MYRICK 13060 allided with the fendering system on the Onslow Beach Swing Bridge. The incident occurred as the tow was transiting southbound at high tide en route to Savannah, GA. As the tow approached the swing bridge (about a mile from bridge), the Master of GRACE MYRICK was about to contact the bridge tender to request a bridge opening when he heard the operator of the crew boat behind the GRACE MYRICK radioed the swing bridge operator asking to open the bridge for vessel transit. The swing bridge operator agreed to the bridge opening and relayed that the bridge was going to open for the vessel ahead of them (GRACE MYRICK) and leave it open for the crew boat and other vessels behind. The swing bridge operator then initiated the opening process of the swing bridge. The swing bridge is controlled by a computer and the bridge operator follows the opening sequence by the visual display in the monitor. From start to finish, the opening sequence takes about five minutes (approx. 3 minutes for the bridge to complete its turn). It has happened in the past when the bridge rarely experienced technical problems during the opening sequence, however the bridge operator can override the system, which only adds a couple seconds to the bridge opening. \n\nDuring the bridge opening, the swing bridge operator was alerted by the system of a fault with the Jack No.2. (the jacks lift the bridge to allow the retraction of end wedges on the east and west underside of the bridge), which is located on the west side of the bridge. After the swing bridge operator engaged the override, the bridge continued on its automatic opening cycle. The Master of the GRACE MYRICK continued on course at the slowest speed the tow could maintain since the ICW was at high tide and the current was about to 2-3 knots. As the tow began to get closer to the bridge and the bridge was still in the process to open, the Master backed down the throttle to stop the momentum of the tow. This caused the Master to begin losing control of the barges as they were set by the current. The stern of the tow drifted to the starboard as the Master attempted to align the barges through the bridge opening. The bridge was fully open and in locked position as the lead barge (STEVENS 1601) approached the bridge opening (about 100 yards from bridge). The lookout, who was posted on the lead barge, provided measurement distances of the fendering system to the Master and had to move around from port to starboard side and over cargo to relay distances to the Master. The Master put the throttle ahead and started to regain control of the tow, and was able to get the lead barge through the opening without incidents. However, the lookout was not able to get around the deck cargo in time to see down the second barge as it was coming through the fendering system. As the tow continued transiting through the bridge, the starboard bow of the MYRICK 13060 allided with the starboard fendering system. The GRACE MYRICK made it through the bridge without alliding with fendering system. The Master continued with its transit along the ICW as he was not able to stop due to the current and other vessels coming behind the tow. The Master thought the damage was minimal and did not call the swing bridge operator to request a damage report. The Master of the GRACE MYRICK stated that the swing bridge operator did not radio them to report damages, but the swing bridge operator stated that he tried to call the GRACE MYRICK on channel 13 and 16 without a response. Approximately 30 feet of the fendering system boarding along the bulkhead were broken or damaged as well as multiple steel I-beam fendering supports. The deckhands checked the voids on the MYRICK 13060, but found no water ingress. The only recognizable damage was an inset and paint scrapes. Coast Guard Waterways was notified of a potential navigational hazard as a portion of a steel I-beam support was submerged during high tide and no longer protected with boards after the allision.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the tow drifting sideways after the throttle was put on full astern. This was followed by the barge allision with the bridge fendering system. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty were: (1) current conditions, (2) inability of lookout to freely move about barges with deck cargo restricting movement on deck, (3) only one lookout posted, and (4) complacency\/situational awareness - delay to request a bridge opening. \n\nIAW ALCOAST 297\/20, this investigation has been downgraded to a data collection."}

{"activity_id":7115120,"brief":"On November 11, 2020 the Towing Vessel GEORGE ELI (FL7620FR) was underway in Biscayne Bay, Miami pushing a deck barge en-route to the Miami Port Blvd Bridge.  During the approach to the bridge the vessel encountered wind gust of 40 mph and a strong funnel current.  These strong winds and current caused the bow of the barge swing outwards and the starboard side of the barge allided with the bridge causing damage to the fender system of the bridge. The operator of the towing vessel moored the vessel at the nearest marina and fled the towing vessel. He failed to notify the operator and the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard was notified two days later by a witness. The owner was called by the duty IO regarding the incident, the owner did not know about the incident until notified by the duty IO. When asked for the contact information of the operator the day of the incident, the owner did not have any information. The owner states that he only speaks to the operator in person and tells him of the job on site. The operator does not have any information in MISLE or MMLD.  A CG-2692 was submitted by the owner of the towing vessel. Initial damage of bridge is $21,000.\n\nAs a result of this investigation the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the barge being sucked into the current and alliding with the bridge. The causal factor that contributed to this casualty was heavy wind gusts and a strong current.\n\nIn aggravation: The incident occurred on November 11, 2020 and was not reported to the Coast Guard until November 13, 2020; as result, an enforcement referral has been initiated for failure to immediately notify.

{"activity_id":7123796,"brief":"On 12 January 2021 at approximately 2359 CST, the inspected towing vessel (ITV) ROBERT CENAC (US Flag, ON 1251904, 56.5 feet long) allided with the CSX Railroad Rigolets Swing Bridge on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) - East near mile marker 34. The vessel was transiting westbound in the Rigolets Pass as part of a transit to Port Bienville, MS and was pushing the SH 238 (ON: CG054302, 195-foot by 35-foot uninspected hopper barge, unloaded). \n\nThe swing bridge was normally in the closed position and only opened when a vessel needed to pass though the Rigolets Pass channel. The bridge was manned locally. When the ITV's pilot requested passage, the bridge tender advised that he would open the bridge after two trains passed. While maintaining position east of the bridge, the ITV captain relieved the pilot as the person in control of the vessel. The captain called the bridge tender after seeing the two trains pass, requesting that the bridge be opened. The bridge tender told the captain that they were going to get the bridge open, but the captain mistook this communication, believing the bridge was open and proceeded with the tow to transit through the bridge. Approximately 1-2 minutes before the allision, the captain saw that the swing span was not completely open and unsuccessfully attempted to stop. The coaming on the forward port side of the barge struck the overhanging south (when open) end of the swing span. The allision damaged the forward port side of the barge, with indentations and cracks to the port side forward bow and port side forward hopper coaming, which cost approximately $5,000 to repair. Damage to the bridge included the swing span's structure and components, the equipment used to open and close the swing span, and electrical and cabling components, which cost approximately $1.1M to repair.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of the ITV ROBERT CENAC's tow with the CSX Railroad Rigolets Swing Bridge. The vessel master thought the bridge was in the open position when he attempted to transit through the bridge. The communication between the vessel master and bridge tender regarding the opening of the bridge was misunderstood by the vessel master. The partially open bridge was not identified by the vessel master because the bridge was missing required navigation lighting marking each end and the top center of the bridge span.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the incident met the reportable marine casualty criteria in 46 CFR 4.05-1 as an unintended strike with a bridge occurred. The level of investigative effort was an enhanced investigation and the incident was classified as a major marine casualty, as the damage from the allision was greater than $500,000.

The vessel departed a boat ramp at Julington Creek at approximately 0637 in with one person, the Operator, on board the vessel. The Operator proceeded north up the St. Johns River checking and baiting crab pots. At approximately 0745 the vessel was spotted by a witness on the Buckman Bridge heading towards crab pot buoy that was adjacent to the Buckman Bridge. As the vessel approached the crab pot buoy the vessel made a sharp left turn and the Operator was ejected from the vessel at approximately 0751.\n\nAfter being ejected from the vessel the Operator was observed attempting to swim towards the vessel, which was making counter clockwise circles at approximately idle speed. A witness on the bridge saw that the Operator was wearing a dark colored t-shirt and was not wearing a life jacket. Immediately following colors at 0800 at Naval Air Station Jacksonville (NAS Jax) the base fire department was alerted to a person in the water south of the Buckman Bridge. NAS Jax fire fighters and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MRW) personnel proceeded out to bridge in a vessel and found the 24\u2019 Carolina skiff making circles at idle speed.

The towing vessels were port-side-to the barge and were facing its stern, whereby the two tugs had SHAUNA KAY in side tow with its stern oriented forward and bow facing aft. The tugs were delivering the barge from Terminal 7 at the Port of Tacoma to Targa Terminal in Hylebos Bay, and C E was positioned toward the stern of the barge, directly forward of JAMES T QUIGG. SHAUNA KAY was loaded with MGO, HSFO, and ULSD when the incident occurred, and the crews observed \"maximum ebb\" low tide at the time of the allision. \n\nAs the three vessels approached the Hylebos Bridge, crewmembers of both tugs, as well as the Tankerman Person-in-Charge (PIC) onboard SHAUNA KAY, were positioned on the starboard side of the barge and called out closing distances to the master of JAMES T QUIGG. The stern of the barge had been towed approximately 20-25 feet past the bridge when the crewmember of C E, an AB Tankerman, notified the master of JAMES T QUIGG that the barge contacted a pier cap pile. The master reportedly felt no impact and was unaware that the allision had occurred until the assist tug's AB informed him. The last closing distance he recollected was one foot from the bridge, and neither the primary tug's crewmember or the barge's PIC felt or observed the strike. Following the event, crewmembers inspected the barge and bridge for damage and noted that barnacles were scraped from the bridge, but no damage to the barge was apparent. The master described the impact area of the barge as roughly abeam to JAMES T QUIGG's towing position, toward the bow end of SHAUNA KAY and on the aft end of the towing configuration.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event of this casualty occurred when the SHAUNA KAY allided with the Hylebos Bridge. The causative factor that contributed to this casualty was the lack of an additional lookout posted abeam of the JAMES T QUIGG when the transit took place."}

Throughput at the Loundon Dam was documented at approximately 45000 CFS.  Down to less than 1 mph in the current, the vessel began to lose steerage. Seeing that the vessel was losing steerage and the tow head was becoming lined up to possibly allide with the subsequent Highway 11 Bridge, the master turned to port attempting to regain steerage. The tow began to top around to port (toward the RDB) and the master was unable to regain control.  The tow allided with the upstream bridge pier footings of the Southern Railroad Bridge and became parallel with the bridge, pinned by the current. For the safety of the vessel and crew, the master directed the vessel to be uncoupled from the tow. An independent surveyor was dispatched to assess the tow and bridge identifying damage to the two barges in the port string. Both barges were flooding in two voids each.  The vessel crew responded by dispatching pumps and conducting temporary repairs.  The barges were removed on the 23rd after the ITV VIKING arrived to assist the UTV BEARCAT.  The next morning an underwater survey was conducted by Norfolk Southern identifying abrasions up to 5\" deep but no structural damage related to the incident.  No repair cost has been associated with the bridge as of completion of that survey.\n\nThe investigation revealed that the initiating event was when the master made a port turn, but was unable to recover steerage, causing the tow to top around in the current and allide with Southern R\/R Bridge support pilings.  Causal factors to the incident were high currents, due to throughput at Loundon Dam estimated at 45000 cfs, and the 1500 GT vessel pushing 8 loaded dry cargo hopper barges, which proved inadequate to maintain steerage in current conditions.  Collective damages to barges estimated at $51,125 by an independent survey."}

As the tow was passing under the HWY 182 Bridge, the top of the spuds on board the CAJUN INTEGRITY struck the span of the bridge.  The allision with the bridge brought the forward momentum of the ITV MR MAX to a stop and it took approximately 1 minute for the spuds to clear the bridge as it scraped along the bottom of the bridge.  The air draft of the spuds onboard the deck barge was 48 feet from the deck.  When the crew was preparing to depart the dock for the voyage, both the Captain and Pilot were concerned about the height of the HWY 182 Bridge.  Company personnel told the vessel crew that the spud barge height was 48 feet.  After the tow was underway and en route to pass under the bridge, the Pilot contacted Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) Berwick Bay and asked for the height of the bridge.  The VTS watch stander reported the bridge to be 50 feet. \n\nWhen investigators arrived to the spud barge, it was found there was no damage to the barge.  Company personnel were there and stated that they verified the spuds on the barge were 48 feet.  Investigators noticed the drafts of the barge was approximately 6.5 feet, which left approximately 6 feet of freeboard on the barge.  Therefore, the total air draft of the spuds on the CAJUN INTEGRITY was 54 feet and the charted height of the HWY 182 bridge is charted at 50 feet.  Minimal damage to the spuds was reported by the surveyors that required welding of the eyelets at the top of the spud but did not affect the spuds operational status.  There was no report of any pollution or injuries as a result of the incident.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the spuds on the CAJUN INTEGRITY and the HWY 182 Bridge.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:\n\n(1) The Captain not taking into account the freeboard of the CAJUN INTEGRITY in determining the total air draft of the spuds on the barge.\n\nOther areas of concern:  Investigators asked to see the vessel's navigation assessment, aka voyage plan, for the voyage including the time of the casualty.  One was not created.  In fact, only one voyage plan was found on board dated February 13, 2021.  While this could have been a causal factor, investigators believed that even with a completed voyage plan this incident would have still occurred due to the Captain's failure to consider the barge's freeboard when calculating air draft. \n\nThe Captain recently was out of work for approximately 1 month due to health concerns.  Investigators questioned him about his medical conditions and the prescriptions prescribed to him.  The Captain stated he was in the process of renewing his MMC and medical certificate and investigators advised him to ensure he disclosed all medications and conditions to the National Maritime Center. \n\nThis case has been referred to enforcement."}

The incident occurred as the towing vessel was pushing ahead three uninspected deck barges (10' by 40' each barge) carrying lumber to a project on Harkers Island. As the tug Captain approached the bridge, the current set the tow to starboard and out of alignment with the bridge opening. When the Captain realized the tow was misaligned, he tried to back down on the main engine, but the engine shut down. Without any other means of propulsion, the current slowly carried the barges into the southern wooden fendering system and two pilings were broken. The Captain was able to restart the main engine and get the barge off the fendering system. In the process of dislodging the barge and fighting the current, the stern of NC5231DD allided with the fendering system on the northern side of the channel, but did not cause any damage. After transiting through the bridge, the Captain spudded down the tug in the vicinity of the Harkers Island Bridge to await direction from the Coast Guard.

The vessel was heading southbound from Norfolk, VA, to Fernandina Beach, FL, with 05 crewmembers on board at the time of the incident. As the tow approach the bridge, the Mate, who was in the direction and control of the LORETTE, posted two lookouts on the barge as a common practice when transiting through bridges. There was a 10 mile visibility, west-northwest wind of approximately 10-15 knots and flood tide. As the barge went under the bridge, a gust of wind set the barge to port. The lookouts provided distance measurements to the Mate via VHF radios as the barge approached the fendering system. The Mate attempted to avoid the allision by quickly turning the rudder to port to bring the barge to starboard. However, the port spud walkway that hung off the side of the barge approximately six feet struck the upper two boards on the eastside fendering system approximately 10 feet from the end. The two boards fell into the water. The walkway had minor structural damage that did not compromise its integrity. No part of the barge\u2019s hull or towing vessel made contact with any part of the bridge. The company followed their Towing Vessel Safety Management System, notified the Coast Guard, and awaited better weather conditions before continuing the transit.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision with the bridge fendering system. The causal factor that contributed to this casualty was: (1) sudden gust of wind that set the barge to port."}

It is believed limited visibility also played a factor in the allision as the Master, admittedly, was not able to see right along the port or starboard sides of the tow due to the high freeboard of the empty barges. Wind was negligible in the area; river levels were on the decline; however, river flow rates were above normal. Once through the span the Master directed the crew to inspect the barge for damage; none reported. The bridge tender conducted a satisfactory operational test of the bridge and reported no damage."}

{"activity_id":7250622,"brief":"On 06 July 2021 at approximately 0430, the ITV ANDREW F KOCH (ON 642137) was transiting down river pushing 15 loaded (dry cargo) barges when it allided with Douglas MacArthur Railroad (RR) Bridge at approximately mile marker (MM) 179 on the Upper Mississippi River (UMR). While navigating through the bridges in the St. Louis harbor, the Pilot was approaching the MacArthur RR Bridge and was unable to see one of the two green (360 degree) navigation lights marking the center of the main channel. The two green lights, one each positioned on the north and south sides of the bridge, act as center channel lights for mariners to align the tow to the center of a bridge span for transiting. The Pilot knew he was not properly aligned to make the bridge and did his best to steer through the bridge spans but his tow allided with the east span at approximately the third coupling back in the port string, causing damage to the RF 920B (ON 1040135). This allision also caused the tow to break apart and drift into the Osage Marine Fleet at approximately MM 178.6, causing six barges to break away from this fleet. The resulting breakaway caused damage to 3 of those 6 fleeted barges; the ACL 01712 (ON 1121741), LTD 749B (ON 1223399) and MTC 1598 (ON 1272190).\n \nAt approximately 0630, all barges had been collected and secured. Besides the previously mentioned barges, the MEM 2425 (ON 1045194) and the RF 951B (ON 1056694), which were in the tow, also sustained damage due to the allision with the bridge and fleet. A survey of the ANDREW F KOCH revealed damage to the exterior superstructure of the ITV which was caused by collecting empty barges.  No damage to the MacArthur RR Bridge was identified.\n \nIt was later discovered that the 360 degree green light on the south side (north light was operational) of the MacArthur RR Bridge was inoperable. It should also be noted that there are three vertical white lights on the (north and south side) MacArthur RR Bridge marking the main channel which were permitted to be unlit. During the course of this investigation, the District 8 Bridge Branch has decided to require Terminal Railroad (owner\/operator of the MacArthur RR Bridge) to have these white lights operational. No other damage, pollution or injuries were reported."}

Both master and steersman were in the pilot house as the Steersman made his first down bound trip through the Nashville bridges at the sticks.  After lining up for transit, the vessel began to drift to port prompting the steersman to come back full to reduce speed.  The port corner of barge ING 1990 made contact with the left descending piling of the bridge causing an approximate 3\" set in just above the port push knee.  The starboard facing wire and several tow couplings parted causing the starboard string of three barges to go adrift.  The starboard string was recovered by the M\/V KEITH DOSS.  The ITV DAVID K WILSON and the remaining three barges in tow became lodged between the port bank and the bridge piling at an angle due to oncoming current.  Another M\/V was able to assist the DAVID K WILSON away from the bridge and back underway without further damage.  Tennessee DOT was notified that the bridge was struck leading to bridge closure and inspectors dispatched to the site.  No damage to the bridge was identified attributed to this marine casualty and the bridge was reopened to traffic that evening.\n\nThe investigation determined the initiating event to be the allision of the ING 1990 against the Veteran's Memorial Bridge.

The bridge operator made a report of damage to the bridge.\n\nDrug and alcohol testing were completed, with negative results.   \n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event was the allision of DOUBLE SKIN 50 being pushed by the POTOMAC to the Raritan Railroad Bridge. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include; (1) Unsuitable current conditions, (2) Failure of Master's attention to line up tow for transit through bridge."}
{"activity_id":7306694,"brief":"On 30 August 2021 at approximately 0015 local time, during Hurricane Ida, an unmanned and undocumented deck barge J137UF (CG1704013), the sunken fishing vessel THREE PIGEONS (ON: 909533), and the uninspected towing vessel (UTV) AUDREY (ON: 505188) allided with the south side of the Leo Kerner swing bridge, across the Barataria waterway in Lafitte La. None of the vessels involved received significant damage. The Leo Kerner Bridge sustained significant damage and was placed out of service to vehicles and marine traffic. This casualty was reported by the local sheriff, the Coast Guard did not receive the required immediate notification of this casualty from the vessel or barge owner\/operator. \n\nOn 29 August 2021, the barge J137UF was moored at Tom\u2019s Marine and Salvage, a salvage and shipyard operation on the Barataria waterway. The barge was secured to 3 piles driven into the mud on its south side, and tied to the super structures of CFV THREE PIGEONS and a second unnamed fishing vessel on its north side. Both fishing vessels were salvaged vessels that were already sunken. The barge and fishing vessels were all located on the south end of the Tom\u2019s Marine property near the east bank of the Barataria Bay Waterway in anticipation of the arrival of Hurricane Ida. The UTV SUPER T and UTV AUDREY were moored and manned at the main dock at Tom\u2019s Marine to respond during the hurricane.\n\nAs the hurricane made landfall, the accompanying storm surge raised the water level in the area between 8-10 feet, and reversed the waterway current causing it to flow upstream. According to the National Weather Service, the New Orleans metro area experienced tropical storm (34 knots\/39 mph) force winds or higher from 0600 Sunday 29 Aug 21 to 0600 Monday 30 Aug 21. Highest recorded wind speed was a gust of 78 knots at 2037 on 29 Aug 21 and a maximum sustained wind of 54 knots on Sunday the 29th at 1740, before the wind gauges failed. \n\nAs the water level rose, at 2350, the barge J137UF lifted the sunken fishing vessels off the bottom, and rose above the piles allowing the barge and both fishing vessels to become adrift. At approximately 0000 on 30 Aug 21, the Captain\/owner of the UTV AUDREY reported that he saw the barge and fishing vessel drift past him headed towards the bridge. UTV AUDREY and UTV SUPER T left the dock to attempt to stop the barge and fishing vessels. The Captains reported that due to wind and current they were unable to catch the barge, and they attempted to return to the shipyard. Due to the extreme weather, neither vessel was able to proceed downstream and were instead blown towards the bridge. The SUPER T grounded on the east side of the waterway, while the AUDREY was pushed into the corner of the barge and the west side of the Leo Kerner bridge's approach span. Both vessels were abandoned in their location for the duration of the storm.\n\nThe THREE PIGEONS allided with and came to rest against the center span of the bridge, while the J137UF made contact with the lower chord of the western side of the bridge, and the AUDREY became wedged under the western approach span of the bridge. The unnamed fishing vessel was found north of the bridge, but contact with the bridge could not be verified. The bridge was pushed off of its foundation towards the north, and the western approach span was lifted off of its support caps. DOT engineers later deemed the bridge unserviceable, and estimated $4.2 million for temporary repairs and over $20 million for permanent repairs.  The damaged bridge was replaced by an ACROW temporary bridge, until a new long-term replacement can be built. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the incident met the reportable marine casualty criteria in 46 CFR 4.05-1 as the allision resulted in property damage that exceeded the $75,000 threshold. The incident was also a serious marine incident\/major marine casualty as the property damage exceeded $500,000. The level of investigative effort was a data collection IAW CG-INV Note 001-2017."}

{"activity_id":7392044,"brief":"17JAN2022-While transiting through the open Henderson Ave Bridge in Pass Christian, MS the MUDD TUG 2 along with the barge CAJUN VISION did allide with the Henderson Ave Bridge fendering system.  Operators state that they were on standby to pass through the bridge and spudded down awaiting contact with MDOT for an opening. Once the bridge operators received word and started opening the bridge the MUDD TUG 2 operators began slowly making their way toward the bridge that was in the process of opening. As the approach, the MUDD TUG 2 operator recongnized that the bridge was opening slowly and that the raised spuds on the CAJUN VISION were potentially going to strike the bridge, so he slowed the tow's appoach.  Slowing the approach caused the operators to lose steerage and direction of the tow as it got into the bridge opening.  The loss of steerage was attempted to be overcome by applying throttle as the tow was in the open bridge slot.  The application of throttle caused the stern starboard of the CAJUN VISION allide with the south west cribbage of the bridge and the port bow of the CAJUN VISION allided with the north timbers of the bridge cribbage.  The barges laying up on the timbers caused minor scrapes to the timbers.  Bridge operators were called to inspect the damage and reported only minor abrasions.  The CAJON VISION incurred no damage from the allision.  Bridge operators attested that the damage was not monetarily estimated because of the minor degree.  As a result of it investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event of the marine casualty to be the operators lack of steerage speed taken while transiting the open bridge."}
{"activity_id":7393322,"brief":"At approximately 2300 EST on February 5, 2022, the hopper barge C172 allided with the Parkersburge Railway bridge while being pushed ahead by the D.A. GRIMM. The allision caused damage to the C172 which started to take on water. The allision also caused the front 3 barges to break free and start drifting down river. In an attempt to retrieve all 3 barges, the D.A. GRIMM grounded at the point of Blennerhassett Island when backing out of the inside channel. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was unexpected drift of the tow to port instead of starboard while approaching the railway bridge. This was followed by the allision, flooding of the C172, the tow break of the front 3 barges, and the grounding of the D.A. GRIMM. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) Geographic location of manuever, higher risk factor, (2) Greater risk due to high water environment, (3) nature of voyage during elevated environmental risks, and (4) Masters decision to retrieve barges in a restricted channel."}
{"activity_id":7393454,"brief":"At approximately 0745 LMT on February 08, 2022, the deck barge CAROLYN SKAVES (O.N. 1300430) was operating in Willoughby Bay conducting construction operations in support of the Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel expansion project. The barge was being operated by Seaward Marine Corporation to install bridge sub-structure components such as pilings using a Liebherr 1300 model mobile crane that operated from the deck of the barge. The crane was affixed to the barge using a centerline cable system that ran from the bow of the barge to the stern, and through a connection point at the body of the crane. The cable system was designed to allow longitudinal movement of the crane but prevent it from passing forward or aft and stop any lateral crane movement. The barge also had stop marks painted on the deck for the crane operator to reference while operating and making repositioning movements. The stop marks identified the aft and forward most position the crane should be positioned on the barge. As the crane operator repositioned the crane to prepare for the next lift, he surpassed the stop marks and the crane tilted and slid from the deck of the barge into Willoughby Bay. The crane operator was able to jump from the crane as it went overboard without sustaining any injuries. The crane was recovered on March 24, 2022 at a total loss of $2M.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the failure of the wire rope centerline attachment followed by the toppling of the crane into the water. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) Loss of situational awareness of the crane operator, (2) Failure of Seaward Marine Corporation to provide means to prevent the crane from passing aft of the wire rope centerline attachment, (3) Failure of the crane operator to use a spotter, and (4) Inadequate strength of the wire rope centerline attachment. \n\nSeaward Marine Corporation was issued two OSHA citations on July 6, 2022 in the amount of $18,646 for violation of 29 CFR 1926.1437(n)(5) failure to provide an adequate physical attachment and 29 CFR 1926.1426 failure to adequately train the crane operator in assessment of risk. \n\nIn accordance with CG-545 Policy Letter 5-10 this case was downgraded to an Informal from a Formal. \n\nRecommend closing this investigation activity without a referral to enforcement."}

{"activity_id":7424234,"brief":"On March 28, 2022, at approximately 2320 EDT, the towing vessel JOHN PARRISH (O.N. 543973) was underway on the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) pushing ahead two uninspected barges, DIDAPPER 78 (O.N. 1306750) and NDC 160 (O.N. 1272830) loaded with miscellaneous cargo when NDC 160 allided with the fendering system of the Onslow Beach Swing Bridge. The incident occurred as the tow was transiting northbound en route to Chesapeake, VA with four crew aboard. As the tow approached the swing bridge, the Master of JOHN PARRISH made contact with the bridge tender and requested a bridge opening. The bridge operator agreed and initiated the opening process of the swing bridge. The swing bridge is controlled by a computer and the bridge operator follows the opening sequence by the visual display in the monitor. From start to finish, the opening sequence takes about five minutes (approx. 3 minutes for the bridge to complete its turn). No problems were reported with the opening of the bridge or its operation. \n\nThe Master of JOHN PARRISH continued on course at the slowest speed since the ICW was at high tide and the current was about to 2-3 knots flowing in the direction of the tow. As the tow began to get closer to the bridge, the Master centered up the barges and tug (approximately 2000\u2019 prior) with the assistance of two lookouts, which were standing forward near the bow of NDC 160 for the purpose of communicating distance, providing guidance, and to line up for transit through the more restrictive bridge draw area. \n\nAs the Master continued on course, he placed both throttles back to idle to take more speed off when he noted a strong following tide and the tow was still maintaining speed despite the change in handle position (placing throttles to idle). At this time, the lookout noticed the tow had drifted off center and was closer to the starboard side of the fendering system and contacted the Master over handheld radio (channel 18) to come more to port. The Master acknowledge the communication. At approximately 200\u2019 from the bridge, the Master started taking the port and starboard main engines in and out of gear, as he had done in the past successfully to assist with slowing the tow and for making course corrections. The tow shifted, but was not notable.\n\nAt approximately 70\u2019 from the entrance to the fendering system, the Master saw the tow was still too close to the east fendering system, and made a slight turn and gave a throttle increase to port. The lookouts again, notified the Master the tow needed to come more to port. As the tow transited through the bridge, the first barge (DIADAPPER 78) made it through without incident; however, the starboard bow corner of NDC 160 allided with the east fendering system. After the allision occurred, the Master had both main engines at clutch and then gave slight throttle and turned the rudder to ease off the fender. This caused the port side of NDC 160 to shift and allide with the western fendering before finial clearing of the bridge.   \n\nThe tow made it through the bridge without any further incident and pushed up on the western bank approximately one half a mile until morning. The Master had the lookouts check all voids on the tug and both barges. No damage, injuries, or pollution was reported to the tug or barges. \n\nThe swing bridge operator called the Master of JOHN PARRISH and notified both sides of the fendering had been struck and had visible damage. Approximately 10 feet of the fendering system, including boarding along the bulkhead on the east side was broken and missing. Additionally, a navigational light, wiring, and fender supports were damaged and missing. The bridge tender notified the Coast Guard due to the potential hazard to navigational, as the navigational light was extinguished and boards were missing.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the tow drifting sideways after the throttles were put into clutch. This was followed by the barge allision with the bridge fendering system. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty were: (1) current conditions, (2) restricted visibility from the bridge, (3) narrow bridge opening, and (4) Master's complacency\/situational awareness."}

The vessel was transiting from the Halliburton Dock in Berwick, LA to Galveston, TX pushing four red flag barges loaded with liquid mud. However, the vessel was restricted by the highwater conditions for transiting through the Morgan City Triple Span Bridges set forth by the Local Notice to Mariner 15\/22. Since there were no available assist vessels in the area to assist in the transit through the bridges, the relief captain decided to break up the tow and ferry two barges at a time down to Central Boat Rentals, before remaking the tow and heading to Texas. The ITV CAPTAIN BOUDREAUX was making its run southbound with the first two barges (LMB 109 and LMB 103) when the stern barge LMB 103 allided with the northeast section of the fendering system of the Morgan City Railroad Bridge. The relief captain was aware of the current shifting the tow when transiting through the Railroad Bridge but had only transited southbound without an assist vessel a couple of times. Upon questioning, the relief captain stated that he knew that he was supposed to stay on the western side of the channel when transiting through the bridge because of the current. However, he decided to transit in the middle of the channel because he believed the tow was small enough to not be affected by the current. The vessel was transiting at approximately 7 mph following a current that was approximately 2 mph. When the relief captain realized that the tow was being sucked to the eastern side of the channel towards the Railroad Bridge, he attempted to reverse but still allided with the fendering system. The impact of the allision resulted in two broken tow wires and scrapes to the port stern of the LMB 109. The tow wires were replaced with extras kept onboard. There was only minimal damage to the fendering system reported by BNSF. There was no report of any pollution or injuries as a result of this incident. \n\nDuring the course of the investigation it was discovered that the relief captain did not have the radar observer endorsement on his credentials. The company was notified of the missing endorsement and educated on ensuring all credentialed mariners had the proper endorsement for the position hired. The vessel was allowed to retrieve the last two barges from Halliburton Dock and remake it tow under the captain with the proper credentials while the company determined the best route for continuing transit with only one fully credentialed captain. After determining to transit back to Texas using only the master as the qualified captain of the vessel in 12 hour shifts, the vessel was allowed to continue its transit by the marine inspectors at MSU Morgan City (MISLE# 7433600).\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the tank barge LMB 103 and the Morgan City Railroad Bridge while it was being pushed by the ITV CAPTAIN BOUDREAUX. The casual factors that contributed to this casualty include:\n1) The miscalculation of the relief captain in maneuvering the ITV CAPTAIN BOUDREAUX under the Morgan City Railroad Bridge that resulted in the tow being pulled towards the eastern side of the channel and into the fendering system of the Morgan City Railroad Bridge.\n2) The high water conditions of the waterways that increased the current flowing south through the Bridge complex and created a suction effect near the fendering system of the bridge that pulled the tow towards the eastern side of the channel."}

{"activity_id":7435544,"brief":"On 17APR22 at approx. 0015 the ITV GARRON L SNEED (O.N. 560609) was northbound with 10 empty dry cargo barges on the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) passing under the center span of the Merchants Railroad Bridge at mile marker (MM) 183.2 when the tow was set off to starboard and the ITV grounded on a partially submerged L-dike. The Capt was able to work the ITV off of ground; however, once he was free the head of the tow had topped around towards the left descending bank (LDB). With the tow almost perpendicular to the flow of the UMR, it drifted down onto the Merchants Bridge and allided with a mooring cell set up on the north side of the IL side bridge pier of the center span. The allision caused the tow to break apart into a single block of 6 barges and 4 individual barges. The Capt was able to recover the block of 6 and 1 of the adrift barges and take them down to the SCF-Lewis and Clark - MRT Fleet at MM 182.0 without further incident; however, the 3 remaining individual barges (ED 1, O.N: 1030817; CTC0119, O.N: 1109839; MEM 5129, O.N: 1066471) floated down river and allided with the McKinley Bridge at MM 182.5. Two assist boats working downriver were able to corral the 3 adrift barges and take them in tow to the same MRT Fleet as the GARRON L SNEED. \n \nThe tow was destined for a coal dock along the right descending bank (RDB) at MM 184.5 and had to utilize the alternate span (center span) of the bridge to avoid the L-dike that protrudes from the tip of the peninsula at MM 184.2 running south to MM 183.3 which separates the Chain of Rocks from the Chain of Rock Canal. As the tow was approaching the center span, the Capt set the tow off a bit further from the MO side pier of the center span due to a moored work-flat (barge), M-8003 (O.N. CG867290). Once the head of the tow was clear of the bridge span the winds picked up from 5 kts to approx. 10-15 kts off of the portside of the tow (from West).  Additionally the natural flow of the river had the current pushing on the portside head of the tow which aided in setting him off to the starboard. The resulting grounding caused the ITV to breach the #3 starboard fuel tank and barge breakaway caused damage to the 3 adrift barges that allided with the McKinley Bridge. The GARRON L SNEED was taken to dry-dock at National Maintenance in Wood River, IL. The 3 damaged barges will remain in the fleet until dock space is opened up to make repairs."}

Stronger than normal currents caused the CHEYENNE to get set over towards the right descending side of the channel and, although the vessel and tow nearly cleared the bridge, the corner of the starboard stern of the CHEYENNE allided with the protection cell. The allision caused the starboard facing wire between the ITV and adjacent barge to part; all other rigging remained intact and no barges broke free. The ITV CHEYENNE subsequently pushed in at MM 42.7, replaced the parted facing wire and inspected the ITV for damage. No damage to either the ITV or the protection cell, later examined by bridge inspector, was identified and the CHEYENNE continued its downriver voyage."}

A crewmember shifted power to the starboard generator within 3-4 minutes and the Master of the ITV pushed the tow in on the LDB MM 643 OHR to assess the cause of failure.  The operating company of the BRIDGET CAULLEY had a Cummins technician come out to their location the following morning but the technician could not replicate the issue.  The Cummins technician ran a diagnostics check using a computer and could not find any issues.  The Vessel was allowed to resume it's voyage to Baton Rouge, LA.  On 09 April 2022 in Baton Rouge, the operating company of the BRIDGET CAULLEY had electrical technicians attend the vessel and the cause was determined.  The cause of the generator shutdown was determined to be the fuel pump shutoff valve being out of adjustment along with a loose ground.  Additional electrical issues were discovered and corrected during the same technician visit.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the port generator shutdown due to the fuel pump shutoff valve being out of adjustment along with a loose electrical ground.  A subsequent event was a loss of steering until the other generator could be manually brought on line."}

The casualty occurred while the vessel was transiting SB pushing 15 loaded dry cargo barges for Marquette Transportation at MM 539 UMR.  As the vessel was transiting around a bend in the river. A strong current of approximately 2 mph pushed the head of the tow to port and caused the vessel to run aground on an island in the river located just outside the channel on the LDB with its port beam.  \n\nUpon running aground the connection wires for the tow separated and 09 barges broke loose from the tow and began drifting downriver. Sector UMR issued a W\/W restriction via an SMIB for MM 544-534 UMR. 06 barges remained connected to the vessel as it was grounded. A group of 06 connected barges (MTC 1473, LTD 723B, LTD 915 B, CH 0062, PML 13100 B, LTD 952 B) and a group of 03 connected barges (AGS 717, AGS 209 B, PML 1314 B) broke loose from the tow and drifted separately downriver. One of the barges in the group of 06 (LTD 915B) had 03 crew members onboard (\"redacted PII\") and the Carrol County, IL Fire Department successfully recovered them and delivered them back to the JONATHAN ERICKSON.  The group of 03 drifting barges allided with the Highway 52 Bridge at MM 538 and as a results, the barge which experienced the allision (AGS 717) was separated from the other two. This separated barge drifted into a wing dike on the LDB at MM 536 where it ran aground. \n\nAn assist vessel, the ITV WILLIAM E LAWSON (O.N. 626510), was in the area and was requested to assist in recovery of the breakaway barges.  The assist vessel was able to successfully recover all remaining 08 breakaway barges at MM 537.  The JONATHAN ERICKSON was able to become ungrounded under its own power after approximately 30 minutes and then began transiting SB to meet with the assist vessel at MM 537 where it reconfigured the 08 recovered barges back into the tow.  The grounded barge appeared to be taking on water and a marine surveyor was requested to come inspect and, if possible, repair any breaches discovered in the hull.  No damage to the other barges or the ITV JONATHAN ERICKSON was reported and only minor damage was discovered on the Highway 52 Bridge which remained fully operational.  No pollution or injuries associated with this incident were reported. Preliminary interview conducted with the vessel master.\n  \n24APR2022, 1230: Marine surveyor arrived on scene at MM 536 UMR LDB to inspect the barge that had appeared to be damaged (AGS 717).  After inspection, breaches in the hull of the #1 bow void tank (12\"x1\") and the #2 port wing tank (18\"x1\") were discovered and water was intruding into those voids.  The marine surveyor proceeded to pump the water out of the damaged void tanks and then initiated temporary repairs using wooden shingles and epoxy to temporarily seal the breaches. After temporary repairs were completed, AGS 717 was reincorporated into the original tow as the 2nd barge in the center string. The tow then transited to an ARTCO fleeting area in Clinton, IA at MM 515 UMR and transferred the cargo carried by AGS 717 to an undamaged barge.  After reconfiguring the tow to include the new undamaged barge, it continued transiting SB to St. Louis, MO, its final destination. AGS 717 to remain at the ARTCO fleeting area until permanent repairs can be completed. \n\nAs a result of its investigation the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the port beam of the vessel running aground at MM 539 UMR on an island in the river located just outside of the navigable channel on the left descending buoy line which resulted in a barge breakaway,allison with a bridge, barge grounding, and subsequent barge flooding.  The cause of this grounding was determined to be an unknown strong river current of approximately 2 knots at the location and time this incident occurred."}

The vessel, deck barge, and spud barge as a single unit had drifted south from the Shallow Water Equipment Dock some time during the previous night. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that although the spud barge had been spudded down, there was not enough slack in the line after the yard workers checked on the spuds the evening prior to account for the tidal influence. There was both an increase in the volume of water flowing down though the Bayou Boeuf railroad bridge, in addition to a tidal variance according to the data collected from the USGS. Since there was not enough room in the lines for the spuds to adjust to the changing water levels, the spuds got detached from the river floor and started to drift out into the channel with the attached vessel THE DOMINO. With the increase in water flowing down from the north, THE DOMINO, deck barge, and spud barge drifted in the channel until it came to stop after alliding with the railroad bridge. The allision with the bridge did not result in any damages to either the structure, the towing vessel, or barges.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the breakaway of the spud barge from the dock. This was followed by THE DOMINO, deck barge, and spud barge to be adrift in the waterway that led to the eventual allision with the Bayou Boeuf Railroad Bridge. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:\n\n1) The improperly spudded down spud barge that did not have enough slack to account for tidal variance and resulted in the vessel and barges to be set adrift in the waterway.\n2) The lack of monitoring or notifications to personnel ashore to alert them of the vessel and barges becoming unsecured and drifting into the waterway prior to it finding its way down to the railroad bridge.

The vessel was returning from the Bayou Chene to the dock at Shallow Water Equipment in Amelia, LA pushing the deck barge loaded with two marsh buggies. As the captain was handling the vessel to make it through the west channel of the railroad bridge, he drove the barge straight into the middle of the center pier due to restricted visibility from THE DOMINO's bridge. The captain stated that he could not see the channel clearly due to the marsh buggies blocking his view and was utilizing the verbal cues from a lookout he had on the bow of the barge to maneuver. There were no radars or cameras installed onboard the towing vessel for the captain to utilize. The barge allided with the center pier at approximately 1.2 miles per hour and caused some minor damage to the sign and sign bracket costing around $1200. There was no damage reported on the barge. There was also no report of any injuries or pollution as a result of this incident. After the barge allided, the captain reversed and went through the eastern channel through the Bayou Boeuf Railroad bridge before stopping at the Shallow Water Equipment Dock. The duty team from MSU Morgan City arrived on-scene to further investigate the incident, but did not arrive prior to the marsh buggy being offloaded the barge. The vessel was still attached to the barge and only had a visual clearance of approximately 8 feet above the unloaded barge.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the deck barge being pushed by THE DOMINO and the Bayou Boeuf Railroad Bridge. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:\n1) The size of the towing vessel THE DOMINO that did not provide enough visual clearance for the captain of the vessel to see past the marsh buggies on the deck barge it was pushing.\n2) The low clearance height of the Bayou Boeuf Railroad Bridge combined with the increased water level that reduced the Master\u2019s ability to see the structure from the low vantage point of THE DOMINO.\n3) The location of the marsh buggies on the deck barge that was directly in the line of sight of the captain of the vessel that prevented him from being able to see where he was going."}

At approximately 0510 the trip pilot again called to confirm bridge opening. While opening the bridge the bridge arms that stop traffic failed to close. The operator called the CJ STDDDERT via VHF and told them to stand by, but CJ STUDDERT did not receive the call because the bridge operators radio had changed channels. CJ STUDDERT continued westbound, and witnessed the railroad bridge on the west side of the Belle Chasse bridge was in the up position but he was was unable to verify the highway bridge position until it was too late. The crane onboard the SHAMROCK 503 made contact with the mid span of the bridge. CJ STUDDERT backed away and began damage assessment. The bridge operator gave CJ STUDDERT permission to transit through the bridge approximately 10 minutes before the allision, but he experienced a bridge malfunction. He left the tender shack without confirming that CJ STUDDERT was aware of the malfunction. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the Bridge tender failed to relay the bridge malfunction to the CJ STUDDERT.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the incident met the reportable marine casualty criteria in 46 CFR 4.05-1 as an unintended strike with a bridge occurred. The level of investigative effort was an informal investigation as the property damage exceeded $75,000 but was below $200,000."}

The bridge was open and the vessel pilot was told he could pass through by the bridge operator. The vessel with tow was transiting inbound from the east while slowly approaching the bridge. As the vessel drew near, the pilot oversteered to the port in an attempt to line up for transit, however the current was too strong and steering toward starboard did not properly orient the tow to pass through the bridge fenders. The Pilot backed down hard, but could not stop before the port corner of the head tow, barge RCT 9, struck the port wooden fender wall on the bridge knocking a hole in it and breaking a wire in the tow. Once the vessel came to stop, the pilot was able to navigate the tow through the bridge without causing any additional damage to the bridge or tow. The bridge operator\u2019s view showed the vessel drifting out of alignment with the bridge navigation channel. No damage was reported to the tow vessel and barges. Damage to the bridge consisted of knocking a hole in the wooden fender wall which protected the bridge pillar.

At the time of the allision, the vessel was in operation carrying 22 passengers onboard.  Upon making contact with the bridge pier, a passenger safety check was conducted resulting with no injuries nor any evidence of pollution.  The vessel went back underway while in contact w\/Owner-Operator whom immediately had the crew of the vessel intentionally go aground on nearby beach front so that the passengers could be safely removed. Owner\/Operator secured another vessel and safely transported the passengers to shore without any further incident.  As a result of SMI crew was submitted drug & alcohol testing that ended with \"redacted Medical PII\" results for the crew.\n\nInvestigation revealed that due to better efficient transit, small craft transiting inbound use the shore side \"wide span\" due to the bridge at the draw is very narrow and difficult to navigate.  Further investigation denoted that with constant development of the adjacent jetty, high tides produce a strong eddy that influence a vessel's navigation transitting the wide spans of the bridge.  To note: only the draw span has fendering structure around the piers while the remaining piers have none in which these spans are regularly transited by local small vessels.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the STAR FISH making contact with the bridge after attempts made to navigate a strong high tide eddy.  This was followed by the vessel sustaining hull damage to the starboard pontoon, allowing water ingress into 3 compartments that lead to the intentional grounding.  Causal factors that contributed to the casualty include; (1) Strong eddy development in adjacent bridge seaward at high tide, (2) no fendering systems are emplaced around bridge piers except the primary draw span."}

{"activity_id":7559566,"brief":"On 8\/24\/2022 the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE, and its 07-barge tow, allided with the CSX 14 Mile Bridge on the Mobile River during its transit under the bridge. \n\nAs the Pilot was navigating the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE and pushing its tow north on the Mobile River, they called the CSX 14 Mile Bridge Tender via VHF-FM Channel 13 and requested\/received confirmation of an opening of the CSX 14 Mile Bridge for a passing at approximately 1211 local.  The ITV AMERICAN was pushing 7 barges in a 3-2-2 configuration with the front three being unloaded hopper barges and the two sets of two being loaded barges.\n\nThe CSX 14 Mile Bridge Tender is at a remote location in Mobile, Alabama at the State Docks Terminal Railway and monitors the bridge by VHF-FM radio, video.  The video is transmitted via satellite communications with a backup of \"digi\" or cellular signal.  When\/if the satellite communications fail, then the \"digi\" system is designed to immediately pick up the communications. One set of sensors on the bridge are beam sensors mounted on the north and south side of the fendering system to alert the remote tender if there is traffic on the river under the bridge.\nAfter the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE requested the CSX 14 Mile Bridge to open, the Bridge Tender checked traffic, opened the bridge, and communicated back to the ITV the bridge was opening.  After opening, the Bridge Tender lost satellite communication and the \"digi\" communications did not immediately connect the video communications with the CSX 14 Mile Bridge.  The Bridge Tender also maintains rail\/train traffic from their station at State Docks Terminal Railway and saw a train approaching the CSX 14 Mile Bridge.  As the train approached the bridge, it received the appropriate signals and began to slow, as part of its safety system which detects open bridges. \n\nThe ITV approached the fully opened bridge and began aligning the tow to pass under the bridge.\n\nThe Tender saw the approaching train and began closing the bridge, without communicating the bridge closure to the ITV. The bridge begins to lower and then moments later, the lead barges, unloaded hopper barges, of the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE enter the bridge tripping the southern beam sensors. This causes the bridge to stop lowering and remain in a slightly closed position. Following the lead barge where loaded barges, which were sitting low enough in the water to be below the river beam sensors.  From video of the bridge, it appears that the bridge tender resumes closing the bridge once the southern sensors are clear of the unloaded hopper barges. At that point, the bridge tender manually lowered the bridge while the northern beam sensors where still obstructed by the unloaded hopper barges. \n\nManually closing the bridge requires the Tender to silence the warning of the bridge\u2019s sensors, which detects when a vessel is under it, and then hit the \u201cChannel not Clear\u201d button twice and the \u201cClose Bridge\u201d button once. The Tender did not have visual on the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE when they manual shut the bridge. \nOnboard the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE, the Pilot was navigating his tow\/vessel between the open CSX 14 Mile Bridge fenders when they noticed the bridge closing. At the time the ITV was making approximately 4.2 knots up the river and the front unloaded hopper barges are north of the bridge; the two sets of loaded barges are transiting under the bridge and the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE is approaching the bridge from the south. The Pilot called the Bridge Tender on VHF-FM 13 and received no answer.  The Pilot began backing down the ITV and tow while the bridge was lowering.  Not thinking they would have time to stop before alliding with the bridge the Pilot sounded the collision alarm.  The bridge continued lowering and settled into the closed position.  The ITV AMERICAN COURAGE lightly allided with the closed bridge causing minor damage to the 02-deck super structure and connected forward awnings of the bridge deck and 02 deck.  The tow face-lines and tow lines snapped causing the tow to continue under the bridge unaccompanied by the ITV.\n  \nApproximately four minutes the train came across the CSX 14 Mile Bridge while the ITV was up next to the bridge.  The Pilot of the ITV again contacted the bridge tender to notify them that the bridge had closed despite their previous communications and arrangements. The Pilot requested the bridge tender open the bridge so the ITV could pass through, and retrieve its tow, which was now on the North side of the CSX 14 Mile Bridge.  The Bridge Tender opened the bridge, and the ITV was able to capture and reconnect to its tow without further damage\/incident.  \n\nThe ITV AMERICAN COURAGE reported the incident to the U.S. Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard ordered the ITV to proceed to Blakely shipyard in Mobile, AL for inspection.  CSX personnel inspected the CSX 14 Mile Bridge for operational integrity and attested that the bridge was undamaged and fully operational.\n\nOn 8\/25\/2022, Coast Guard Investigators boarded the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE at Blakely Shipyard and interviewed the operators of the vessel and inspected the damage.  All navigational equipment appeared operational and in good working order.  Damage was noted on the 02 superstructure and bridge awnings.  \n\nCG Investigators then visited CSX personnel at the State Docks Terminal Railway where the Bridge Tender was stationed.  The Bridge Tender stated that after a period of time, they noticed that the expected rail traffic was approaching the open 14-mile bridge and assumed that the bridge would be clear.  The Bridge Tender also stated they made a broadcast on VHF radio that they were was shutting the 14-mile bridge (VHF transcript didn\u2019t indicate a broadcast), and then they began shutting the bridge.  The Bridge Tender stated that visual camera came back online, and they didn\u2019t notice the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE in the bridge opening; however, throughout the incident, the towing vessel or its barges can be seen in at least one of the four cameras at all times.  \nThe Bridge Tender\u2019s lack of situational awareness of the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE during its crossing into and through the open CSX 14 Mile Bridge and closing the bridge was the primary factor for the reportable casualty.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event of this marine casualty was the allision of the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE with the CSX 14 Mile Bridge. Contributing factors to the casualty include 1) The bridge tenders lack of situational awareness regarding the location ITV AMERICAN COURAGE 2) Oncoming train traffic panicked the Bridge Tender despite the train slowing for the open bridge 3) Bridge Tender\u2019s lack of Automatic Identification System (AIS) functionality to access vessel traffic at the time of the bridge closure 4) The height of the bridge sensors on the river  5) Mechanical error when the Bridge Tender lost satellite communications and \"digi\" communications."}

The bridge operators were able to get the bridge closed after the allision; however, the bridge was closed to marine traffic until repairs could be made the following day. Damage to the bridge was estimated at $10,000, with no damage occurring to the tug or barge.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined the initiating event for this casualty to be an allision. Contributing factors to this casualty included; 1) lack of horizontal clearance when pushing barge through opening of swing bridge, as navigation lights on the bridge stick out into the opening\/channel of the bridge, 2) wind pushed the barge to port while transiting through the bridge opening, further reducing clearance, and 3) Vessel Master lined the barge up with the bridge opening; however the wind set the barge up against the fendering system and he could not maneuver in time to avoid the light."}
{"activity_id":7562235,"brief":"On September 18, 2022 at approximately 1839 EST the vessel POLAR MEXICO was departing North Charleston Terminal outbound of the Cooper River. During the transit the vessel was to pass under the I-526 (Don Holt Bridge) where current NOAA readings were showing an air gap of (48.1 meters, 157.8 feet). Prior to departure the pilot and master conducted their exchange and noted the vessels air draft on the pilot card to be (46.7 meters\/153.2 feet), which gave the vessel approximately 4.6 feet of clearance under the bridge. The highest point of the vessel was the No.2 Crane located aft of No.1 Crane; when passing under the bridge the No. 2 crane railing located at the top of the crane arm made contact with the bridge. The railing was warped and a 6ft section was ripped off, no further damage to the crane or ship structure was identified. The vessel was traveling to the right of the channel due to a radar beacon light hanging lower than the bridge.\n\nAs a result of this investigation the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event was the allision of the vessels No. 2 Crane and the i-526 Don Holt Bridge. Due to no reported damage to the bridge and minimal damage to the vessel this investigation ends at the data collection level."}
{"activity_id":7567653,"brief":"On 28AUG2022, the inspected towing vessel ENDEAVOR (O.N. 570902) owned and operated by SEABRIDGE INC, a subsidiary company to Cabras Marine Corp in Piti, Guam, was involved in a marine casualty while moored alongside the Port of Saipan.  The master had sustained an injury that required medical treatment beyond first aid; as the master had tripped on the bottom door frame of the bridge wing door and struck his head on the captain's chair.  He did not look at his face\/head for signs of injury and went to sleep and was woken up a few hours later by another crew member who saw the master's forehead had a large laceration; the master drove himself to a local medical facility for diagnosis and treatment where he received stitches - a medical treatment beyond first aid.  The company held him back from sailing with the vessel, and he flew back to Guam by the end of that week.  A post casualty drug and alcohol test was administered to all eight crewmembers that were onboard the ENDEAVOR, even the ones that were not directly involved with the incident and were sleeping.  Neither CG Marine Safety Detachment Saipan nor Sector Guam Command Center received any notification of the injury to the vessel's master, and the CG was only finally informed of the incident due to \"redacted Medical PII\" drug test result on 18OCT2022.  A written report of the marine casualty (CG-2692) and the serious marine incident involving vessels in commercial service form (CG-2692B) following an SMI were not completed nor submitted by the owner\/operator, SEABRIDGE INC until 21OCT2022.\n\nFollowing the injury incident of the ENDEAVOR's master, a USCG credentialed mariner submitted to a post-accident drug test on 28AUG2022 at 7:45 PM at the SEABRIDGE INC. facility in Saipan, CNMI, and collected by a Collector with Reliance Testing (Saipan) of Saipan, CNMI.  On 09SEP2022, the specimen was tested in a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) approved laboratory, and on 12SEP2022 a Medical Review Officer (MRO) verified the lab result that the specimen tested \"redacted Medical PII\".  The Coast Guard was notified of the \"redacted Medical PII\" test on 21SEP2022.  Although the mariner tested \"redacted Medical PII\", the OCMI will not be pursuing suspension and revocation action against the mariner for the following reasons: \n\n1.  The marine employer knew or should have known that the only directly involved person was the injured master, however the employer order to test the whole crew was inappropriate under 46 CFR Parts 4 and 16; the company proceeded to test everyone onboard, since the mariner that tested \"redacted Medical PII\" was asleep at the time of the incident, he therefore was not directly involved with serious marine incident.  Per 46 CFR \u00a7 4.03-4  \u201cThe term individual directly involved in a serious marine incident is an individual whose order, action or failure to act is determined to be, or cannot be ruled out as, a causative factor in the events leading to or causing a serious marine incident.\u201d  \n2.  The Collector was informed to conduct a DOT urine collection post-accident as requested by SEABRIDGE INC., Saipan DER.  In this instance, there was no legal cause for the mariner to submit to a DOT drug test.  Although it was a \"redacted Medical PII\" result, the reason for the test and testing protocol was determined to not be able to be utilized in Suspension\/Revocation proceedings. \n\n3.  Testing the whole crew, as in this instance, is contrary to the company's policy.  The company policy says, \u201cDirectly Involved in a Serious Marine Incident:  A marine employer is responsible for determining what personnel were directly involved in a Serious Marine Incident.\"  This determination should be based on the operation being performed at the time of the accident, and what personnel could have or should have had a role in that operation.  The vessel was moored at the Port of Saipan and no operations were in progress, the master was conscious and could articulate what happened, ruling out other\u2019s negligence."}
{"activity_id":7567886,"brief":"On August 10, 2020, at 1645 Eastern Standard Time, the inspected towing vessel ROCKET, O.N. 275027, was downbound on the Ohio River with a crane barge and an excavator barge (02 barges) strung out. The forward starboard spud of the lead barge in the tow (crane barge) came into contact with maintenance scaffolding on the Tenth Street Wheeling Highway Bridge mile marker (MM) 90.3 on the Ohio River and knocked down scaffolding.\n\nThe Master at the time of the incident used only the chart and its vertical clearance when performing the navigational assessment for daily operation. The vertical clearance at the Tenth Street Wheeling Highway Bridge on the chart was 56.2 feet. The barge the spud was sitting on had approximately 3 feet draft, and 6 feet of freeboard. The Master was told that the spuds were stowed with spuds protruding 50 feet from the deck of the barge. He did not know the exact measurements of each spud. The spuds are 64 feet in length and the vertical clearance with the freeboard and spuds combined totaled approximately 55 feet. When the Master completed his navigational assessment the morning of the incident, he did not consult Local Notices to Mariners for the area. Coast Guard District 8 published Local Notice to Mariners (LNM) 11-22 which stated the vertical clearance on the Tenth Street Wheeling Highway Bridge (known locally and in the LNM as Wheeling Suspension Bridge) may be reduced by two feet through June 2023. It was included in their August 3, 2022 LNM 31-22  publication distributed to the D8 maritime community.\n\nCoast Guard Marine Safety Unit (MSU) Pittsburgh distributed a document titled \"Marine Safety Unit Pittsburgh Waterways Information\" at the Waterways Association Pittsburgh meetings held in July and August that state that the Ninth Street Bridge at MM 90.8 on the Ohio River was undergoing maintenance and vertical clearance could be reduced by four (04) inches. The document was distributed to local maritime industry partners at both meetings. The document was not properly edited before it was distributed and listed the wrong bridge, MM, and location and did not mention ongoing work at the Tenth Street Wheeling Highway Bridge at all. The Master of the ROCKET did not consult this document when performing the navigational assessment for the vessel transit on August 10, 2022. Maintenance was being performed at MM .8 at the Ninth Street Bridge on the Allegheny River. MSU Pittsburgh Waterways Division has corrected the document to be distributed to industry to reflect correct mile markers and bridge names per navigational charts and local notices to mariners in effect for the Pittsburgh AOR. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of the starboard forward spud on the crane barge with the scaffolding on the Tenth Street Wheeling Highway Bridge (Wheeling Suspension Bridge). The causal factors that contributed to this casualty are: 1) failure of the Master of the ROCKET to consult LNM when performing the navigational assessment which reduced vertical clearance by two (02) feet, 2) failure of the Master to know the vertical clearance needed for the tow.\n\nThough not a contributing factor to this casualty, this incident identified waterways information handed out to marine industry partners by MSU Pittsburgh was not correct information and could contribute to future marine casualties if the information is in fact used to perform navigational assessments by towing vessel Masters that operate within MSU Pittsburgh AOR."}
{"activity_id":7568076,"brief":"On June 14, 2022, at approximately 1900 local time, the U.S. flagged towing vessel RIVER CAT (535117) was pushing a barge (DB ALAMEDA) when the crane onboard the barge struck the Fruitvale Railroad Bridge near Alameda, CA.  The crane struck the bridge during transit underneath the bridge, which caused minor damage to the bridge and more significant damage to the crane.  \n\nThe master of the towing vessel reported the allision to the U.S. Coast Guard.  Both the master and the deckhand of the RIVER CAT were directed to take Post-casualty DOT drug tests.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, the U.S. Coast Guard determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision itself.  Causal factors that contributed to the initiating event were:  Master's Failure To Properly Prepare For Transit; Inadequate Bridge Clearance Communications; and Bridge Operator Failure to Report Available Clearance. \n\nEnforcement for failing to review Local Notice to Mariners, which listed partial opening of the Fruitvale Railroad Bridge at 80 feet, was considered in this case.  However, the investigation concluded that the master did ask for a full lift at the Miller Sweeny and Fruitvale Railroad Bridge portion of the transit and the bridge operator (who operates both bridges) confirmed a full lift was provided.  The master was not aware of the bridge operator policy to specifically request a lift of the Fruitvale Bridge, which is located in the same vicinity as the Miller Sweeny Vehicle Bridge. While the master should have reviewed Local Notice to Mariners, prior to the transit, the investigation did not conclude that enforcement is warranted; given the circumstances that the master requested a full lift of both bridges and there was a communication breakdown between the bridge operator and master.\n\nFollow-Up Actions:\n\nThe Investigating Officer in this case worked with Coast Guard Eleventh District (D11) Bridge Section following this incident.  D11 has initiated a request, through National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to update nautical chart #18649 with the following updated bridge clearance heights:\n\nOakland Inner Harbor Bridges\n\nFruitvale Ave RR Lift Bridge (37\u00b046'08.3\"N 122\u00b013'50.1\"W)\nHOR CL 200 FT\n\nVERT CL 13 FT DOWN\nVERT CL 80 FT PARTIALLY OPEN, POSITION AT ALL TIMES\nVERT CL 135 FULLY OPEN, WHEN REQUESTED\n\nIn addition, D11 is requiring the bridge owner to revise the bridge's lighting to coincide with the adjacent Fruitvale Vehicle Bridge.\n\nRecord of this request is contained in this activity's correspondence section."}

The NDC 160 was attached to the port side of the KENDALL J HERBERT and the DIDAPPER 78 was attached to the starboard bow of the NDC 160, directly in front of the KENDALL J HERBERT. The tow was underway on the Elizabeth River heading southbound through the Gilmerton Bridge. As the Mate made his approach to the bridge and began making the right-hand turn, the angle and direction of the tow caused the barge NDC 160 to approach the East side of the fender system. The Mate backed the engines down and slowed the tow to .5 knots, but could not avoid hitting the Gilmerton Bridge fender. The NDC 160 allided with the East side of the fendering system causing damage to one rubber fender at an estimated cost of $5,000. The Mate did not report the allision to the Coast Guard because he stated this is the purpose of the fender system. \n  \nThe tow's allision with a bridge raises the presumption of negligence on the part of the towing vessel operator. Wireless device distraction was ruled out.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event was the barge's allision with the Gilmerton Bridge. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) Mate's failure to properly align the vessel for maneuvering. \n\nRecommend closing this investigation with a referral to enforcement."}

{"activity_id":7572710,"brief":"On October 02, 2022 at approximately 0159 hours, the Towing Vessel SAINT EMILION (O.N. 1216794) was pushing ahead the Tank Barge A-87 (O.N. 1255066) and had transited northbound on the Hudson River enroute to the APEX Terminal in Glenmont, NY.  As the Towing Vessel and Tank Barge approached the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, also known as the Tappan Zee Bridge, near Tarrytown, NY, the Mate, who was on watch in the Pilothouse had nodded off, and the starboard bow of the A-87 Tank Barge allided with the bridge, sustaining significant damage to the forward starboard section of the vessel.  After the allision, the Towing Vessel and Tank Barge anchored approximately one nautical mile north of the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge to conduct a damage assessment.  The crew discovered a hole below the water line of the #1 void space located on the starboard side of the Tank Barge, forward of the collision bulkhead.  The crew opened the cover to the #1 void space and observed that there was water engress and flooding into the space.  The A-87 Tank Barge had a cargo capacity of 80,000 barrels and at the time of the incident the cargo onboard consisted of 25,000 barrels of gasoline and 18,000 barrels of ultra low sulfur heating oil.  The crew transferred the gasoline cargo in the #1 Port and Starboard cargo tanks to the #5 Port and Starboard cargo tanks which prevented further flooding into the #1 void space.  The Towing Vessel and Tank Barge then proceeded to the Center Point Terminal, located in Newark, NJ to discharge its cargo.  After the discharge of cargo was completed, the Tank Barge then proceeded to Clean Waters located in Staten Island, NY, in preparation for hull repairs that took place at the Caddell Dry Dock and Repair Co., Inc., also located in Staten Island, NY.  Sector New York Inspections Division issued a CG-835 to rectify the Tank Barge hull damage deficiency prior to movement.  Repairs to the forward starboard section of the vessel encompassed the main deck, bulwarks, side shell plating, and lower chine bottom plating from centerline to starboard just aft of the vessel's draft markings, and from waterline to main deck.  Furthermore, Poling & Cutler Marine Transportation updated the company's Towing Safety Management System (TSMS) to include two additional navigational requirements which have been implemented fleet-wide.  The first requirement is that when underway, a second person must be on watch in the Pilothouse from 2200 to 0600.  This second person must be on watch in the Pilothouse in addition to the Master from 2200 to 2400 and the Mate from 0000 to 0600.  The second requirement is that when underway, the Bridge Navigational Watch Alarm System (BNWAS), which is the vessel's Pilothouse Alerter System, must be set for no more than 3 minutes.  \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the result of the Mate switching to autopilot then falling asleep in the Pilothouse while on watch as the SAINT EMILION and A-87 approached the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge.  The Mate's inattentiveness negatively impacted the manaueverability and navigation of the Towing Vessel and Tank Barge.  This was followed by the hull damage and flooding of the A-87 Tank Barge.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) improper oversight of the Master to implement a Pilothouse lookout, (2) ineffectiveness of the crew to enforce the change of watch procedures, (3) failure of the Mate to follow the company's navigation policy, (4) failure of the Pilothouse Alerter System to activate an alarm, (5) the absence of a qualified lookout, (6) no means to prevent hull failure upon allision with the Governor Mario M. Cuomo bridge, and (7) no means to prevent flooding consequent to hull failure."}

The vessel operator contacted the CG to request assistance make notification of the casualty. The operator reported that a head gasket had blown, sending hot steam into the engine space and cabin, after the engine shutdown. To slow his drift, he threw his anchor overboard and, once he got close enough to the pilings of the old Youngs Bay bridge, he made his vessel off to the piling to keep him from drifting ashore while he was dead in the water. Coast Guard Station Cape Disappointment towed the vessel safely to the pier.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the loss of propulsion was caused by a blown head gasket which caused the engine to shut down.

{"activity_id":7579799,"brief":"On 27 September, 2022 at approximately 0755 EST, the inspected towing vessel SIGNET TITAN was docking its barge, CHICAGO BRIDGE, at Blount Island in Jacksonville, FL when it experienced a reduction of propulsion.  While preparing to dock the barge, the port main engine unintentionally shutdown reducing the SIGNET TITAN\u2019s propulsion and ability to maneuver.  The crew was able to quickly restart the engine and bring the barge into dock without further incident.  The crew attempted to diagnose the cause of the failure and made the determination that the port main engine probably stalled from moving too quickly from ahead to astern.  The vessel would suffer from an additional loss of propulsion event days later in Puerto Rico and a technician would find water build up in control systems of the starboard main engine.  It is highly probable the mechanical failure of the port engine on the 27th of September was a result of a combination of moisture build up and fast throttle changes made during maneuvering.  \n\nThe master on watch, hereby known as the respondent, did not make any kind of notification of the mechanical failure or reduction of propulsion event on the 27th of September to the local Coast Guard Sector as per 46 CFR 4.05-1 and the company\u2019s own reporting procedures located in its MMS .

{"activity_id":7581832,"brief":"On 15OCT2022 at approximately 2302cst: the Western Rivers Command Center received notification of a marine casualty that occurred, at approximately 2245cst, onboard the ITV AUBREY B HARWELL JR (O.N. 579561) on 15OCT2022. The casualty occurred while the vessel was transiting NB through the Sabula Railroad Drawbridge at MM 535 UMR pushing 14 dry cargo barges for Ingram. As the vessel was transiting through the bridge, the Master of the vessel was conducting training with a break-in pilot who was at the helm.  The vessel master was directing the trainee on how to enter the bridge transit area and he stated, due to low water conditions on the UMR in that location, the current speeds were much slower than normal. This caused the master and trainee to midjudge their approach to the bridge transit area and gently allide with the LDB protection cell with the third barge in the tow\u2019s STBD string (T13871). After the allision, the crew of the vessel conducted a round of the entire tow and discovered no DPI or flooding.  The bridge personnel also reported no damage had been discovered at that time. After the allision, the tow continued transiting NB en route to St. Paul.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this incident was an unintended allision with the Sabula RR Drawbridge.  The cause of this allision was determined to be pilot error and no other contributing factors were found to be involved."}

The starboard spud on the DREDGE HULL barge struck scaffolding used to perform maintenance on the Smithfield Street Highway Bridge. No pollution, or damage to the vessel and bridge were reported. Cost to replace damaged metal sheeting was approximately $4500 and verfied with maintenance contractor.\n\nThe Master was told by the crane operator that the spuds were protruding about 40 feet of the deck of the barges. The crane operator stowed the spuds in their pins on all of the barges for transit. The overall length of the starboard spud on the DREDGE HULL barge was 50 feet. The barge depth was 8 feet and the barge was drafting 4 feet. Approximately 42 feet of the spud was protruding from the deck of the barge. The Master only used the navigational chart when performing the navigational assessment for transit. LNM 33-22 reducing clearance at the Smithfield Street Highway Bridge by 1.5 feet was in effect for bridge maintenace. Master was not aware of the LNM when he performed the navigational assessment. All of the other spuds on the other barges cleared the bridge at the time of the incident. The Master had three people out on the tow to ensure spud clearance of the tow and was told that it appeared that the spud was not going to clear the bridge maintenance euqipment. He was going ahead at a slow bell as the tug and tow passed beneath the bridge to ensure clearance. When he was told the barge wouldn't clear, he started backing but the starboard spud on the DEREDGE HULL barge contacted sheeting on scaffolding for the bridge and the sheeting came loose.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of the starboard spud on the DREDGE HULL barge with the scaffolding on the Smithfield Street Highway Bridge. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: 1) Master did not utilize LNM when performing navigational assessment 2) Master did not know that the clearance at the Smithfield Street Highway Bridge had been reduced by 1.5 feet 3) Master did not know exact height of spuds on barges in tow and  4) Master based vertical clearance needed for spuds in tow on information told to him by crane operator. Following the incident, vessel operator began monitoring LNM to alert crews on board vessels of LNMs pertaining to areas its vessels transit."}

The allision occurred when the crew members of the CASPIAN DAWN struggled to get the towing line onboard, and the vessel turned sideways to the current near the bridge abutment. Due to an ebb current and the vessel\u2019s position in relation to the bridge abutment the Mate was unable to maneuver the CASPIAN DAWN out of the area before alliding with the Brigantine Bridge. The CASPIAN DAWN struck amidship on the starboard side and suffered a 4-6\u201d inset in the hull plating comprising the bulwark and below the waterline.  The Brigantine Bridge suffered no damage as a result of the casualty.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision with the Brigantine Bridge as the CASPIAN DAWN\u2019s crew attempted to rig a tow line.  This was followed by an inset of the vessel\u2019s starboard hull plating. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) Inadequate training on the Risk Assessment Program section in vessel's TMSS, (2) lack of assigned lookout during towing operations, and (3) inadequate illumination in vessel\u2019s wheelhouse to allow operator to monitor rudder angle indicators.

{"activity_id":7588343,"brief":"On November 1, 2022, at approximately 2245 local time, the motor vessel (M\/V) AMERICAN EMPRESS was underway on the snake river, at mile marker 61.7, when they attempted to transit under the Camas Prairie Railroad Bridge (locally known as the Toucan Bridge). The vessel's deckhands were on the upper\/aft portion of the pilot house (referred to as steel beach on board the vessel) to lower the vessels antennas prior to transiting under the bridge. As part of the vessel's standard operating procedures, the vessel's deckhands put all the antennas down with ample time prior to arrival at the bridge, with the exception of the Satellite Compass antenna, which stay up to ensure the vessel is able to maintain proper heading, until just before arrival at the bridge. The deckhand remains on the back of the pilot house until the vessel has passed under the bridge and puts the antennas back up. During this particular evolution, the deckhand had a trainee with him, and was distracted, showing her how to see the bridge through binoculars and forgot to put the last antenna down. As the vessel passed under the bridge, approximately five inches of the Satellite Compass antenna struck the bridge, fracturing the fiberglass cover and bending the antenna backwards. There was no damage to the structure of the vessel. Damage to the bridge is unknown. \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the Satellite Compass antenna striking the bridge and the subsequent event was the antenna breaking. The primary causal factor was the failure of the deckhand to put the antenna down as he had a loss of attention and situational awareness.

{"activity_id":7593832,"brief":"At approx. 2000 on 31OCT22 received report of a bridge allision of the Ellender bridge by the ITV Mr. Landon while the ITV was pushing ahead a crane barge with spuds in excess of 98' in Sulphur, LA. The bridge operator reportedly observed minor damage to the bridge and the ITV is reporting a partially bent pile on spud on the crane barge. No injuries were reported during this incident. The suspected cause of the bridge is reported by Louisiana Department of Transportation (LADOT) to be due to the bridge not being sufficiently elevated as the ITV and Crane Barge transited through the bridge after being raised. \n\nAt approx. 1930 on 31OCT22, the ITV MR. LANDON as lead towing vessel pulling the Spud Barge MIKE H in vicinity of MM 243 struck the Ellender Bridge on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway in Sulphur, Louisiana. The object that struck the Ellender bridge was the port side 100' spud on the Spud Barge Mike H causing an estimated $100,000 of damage to the barge and spud and no nominal reported damage to the bridge. The incident occurred due to the bridge not being elevated to the requested height to accommodate the rising studs on the Stud Barge MIKE H (requested bridge elevation was 120' from the master of the MR. LANDON).The bridge operator was inexperienced with novel defects with the bridge skew and height gauging giving the bridge tender a false impression of the actual and true height of elevation during his implementation of the bridge raising evolution. There were no reported injuries as a result of the allision and no damage to the bridge, allowing for immediate return to normal bridge operations. \n\nThe causal factors that contributed to this casualty were determined to be:\n\nWorkplace \u2013 Supervision: Lack of adequate training for new bridge operator.\n\nThe assigned personnel was working as a Bridge Tender in a temporary relief capacity for Louisiana Department of Transportation. The Louisiana Department of Transportation that oversees bridges in Southwest Louisiana had recently had a severe employee shortfall due to an ongoing internal investigation, degrading the previous reliable manning with staff familiarized with the bridge tending duties, equipment and operations. This inexperienced Bridge Tender, while working in temporary relief capacity, was never given in-person resources to familiarize with bridge tender operations. The bridge tender considered improper gauging readings were accurate and true. It is reasonable to believe that had this employee been given proper supervision from experienced personnel up to and including management of the bridge raising operations, and novel defects, that he would have raised the bridge elevation higher than what the defective gauge was reporting, alleviating the possibility of an allision.\n\nPrecondition-Vessel\/Facility\/Equipment (Hardware)\u2013 Condition: Failure to properly calibrate the bridge Height and Skew indicator.\n\nThe bridge director for Louisiana Department of Transportation stated that the skew and height indicating gauges are not reporting an accurate measure of the real time elevation of the Ellender bridge when being operated by the bridge tender. The skew and height indicating gauges are required to be calibrated at differing intervals and renewed when needed to ensure proper reporting of elevation above. The bridge operator believed he had the bridge elevated at 125' as indicated on the skew and height indicating gauges, however the elevation was well below 120' as the height of the port spud on the spud barge MIKE H was approximately 120' tall indicated a minimum gauge drift of over 5'. It is reasonable to believe that if the height and skew gauges were calibrated, the bridge operator would have been able to elevate the bridge to requested height on basis of accuracy of height and skew gauges.\n\nPrecondition-Mismatch - Between Person and Hardware: Inexperienced Personnel operating as Bridge Tender with known defects.\n\nDuring an employee shortfall resulting from internal investigations at the Louisiana Department of Transportation, the organization filled in bridge tender vacancies with personnel from different departments. The inexperienced personnel were not familiarized with experiential knowledge of the mechanics and operations of bridge tending duties in conjunction with novel defects on the Ellender Bridge skew and height gauging. It is reasonable to believe that had the organization resourced personnel experienced with bridge tending duties in conjunction with known bridge defects, that the Ellender Bridge allision could have been prevented.\n\nDefense-Does Not Exist: No defenses exist for the ITV MR LANDON and Spud Barge MIKE H.\n\nOn basis of facts resulting from this marine casualty investigation, no defenses that would have prevented the bridge allision exist pertaining to the ITV MR LANDON and Spud Barge MIKE H."}

The vessel was coming from Lake Charles, LA headed to the Ponchartrain Construction facility in Amelia, LA.  While underway, the lead barge of the tow, 525, allided with the Bayou Beouf Railroad Bridge.  The Master, who had transited this area 4 months ago, stated that as he was approaching the bridge, he was unsure of the width of the span and called the bridge tender to request the data.  The width was 56 feet and the tow had a width of 55 feet with the smaller spud boat attached to the tow.  \n\nEven though he only had 1 foot of clearance, the Master decided to attempt to pass through the bridge spans at a slow speed of 1 knot.  His plan was to land the tow on the starboard fender and use the fender as a pivot to get the tow into position.  The small spud boat was the central pivot point and as the tow was pivoting, the lead barge unintentionally made contact with the port fender system.  The damage was minor and consisted of one wooden plank falling out of place.  Throughout this evolution, the Master of the MR LEON employed a lookout on the bow who did not provide any warning of allision until seconds before it occurred.   \n\nWhen asked why he attempted the transit with the spud boat, which added 20 feet to his tow's width, the Master stated he could not let the boat go on his own and required the operator of the boat to remove it from the tow.  In his words, this was due to \"insurance purposes.\u201d  The voyage plan indicated no knowledge of the bridge's width and the Master seemed to know very little about the characteristics of the bridge, believing that the spans had different maximum passing widths despite the bridge tender saying otherwise\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined the initiating event for this casualty to be the allision with the bridge fender.  \n\nThe causal factors include:\n(1) The failure to conduct proper voyage planning procedures.\n(2) The failure of the lookout to notify the Master of possible allision in ample time."}

The casualty occurred while the vessel was transiting SB at MM 517.9 UMR and entering the Clinton RR Swing Bridge transit area while pushing 15 dry cargo barges for Ingram Barge Company LLC. As the vessel was approaching the bridge, the pilot attempted to align the tow so to as avoid an allision. The pilot misjudged the distance to the right descending bridge protection cell, and as a result an allision occurred between the tow\u2019s STBD lead barge (IN075195) and the right descending protection cell.  The bridge suffered minor damage to its protection cell and remained fully operational, and the tow experienced the separation of barge wires and an inset on the barge's STBD bow. The vessel\u2019s crew conducted a round of the vessel and barges and discovered no flooding or additional damage. After the allision the vessel\u2019s crew reconnected the separated barge wires and the tow continued its transit SB. No additional DPI reported.\n\nAccording to the CG-2692A (Barge Addendum) submitted by the vessel\u2019s owning company (Ingram Barge Company LLC), the inset in the STBD lead barge (IN075195) was above the waterline and did not lead to any water intruding into the barge\u2019s voids or cargo holds. The inset was on the bow of the barge approximately 4\u201d from the STBD bow corner and runs 2.5\u201d in length. The estimated costs related to the damage was reported by the company to be approximately $57,000.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, the Coast Guard has determined the initiating event for this casualty to be an allision between the right descending protection cell of the Clinton Railroad Swing Bridge and the ITV AARON F BARRETT\u2019s STBD lead barge (IN075195). The allision was determined to be caused by improper navigation by the pilot of the vessel as he was attempting to enter the Clinton Railroad Swing Bridge transit area with the tow."}

The vessel was conducting a southbound transit along the Atchafalaya River pushing ahead two loaded strung-out barges (KIRBY 29123 and KIRBY 29149).  As the tow was transiting under the Morgan City Railroad Bridge, the port stern quarter of the towing vessel grazed the eastern fender.  There was no damage to the vessel and the structural integrity of the bridge was undamaged.  The fender system required minimal repairs costing $450.00.  At the time of the incident, the Atchafalaya River was experiencing a current of 1.2 knots and a southwesterly wind of 3 knots.  \n\nThe Morgan City Railroad Bridge is one of three bridges that are located within close proximity to each other.  For longer tows that are southbound, there is a bend in the river that a wheelman must consider.  Typically, the tow is likely still clearing the bridge when the approach is being made for the turn.  The master stated that when he was passing under the bridge, he understood that the waterway conditions including the current combined with the turn meant that the tow would slide passing under the bridge.  He anticipated a slide; however, he underestimated it and ended up sliding more than expected.  \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined the initiating event to be the ITV SPINDLETOP alliding with the Morgan City Railroad Bridge.

{"activity_id":7628993,"brief":"On January 18th, 2023, the vessel agent for the bulk carrier STAR HELENA had arranged for pilotage and a pilot was dispatched to bring the vessel to berth.  Once on board, the pilot got the vessel underway to the ADM dock.  During the transit the master passed vessel information to the pilot which included draft readings. The master reported an air draft of 41.9M and a deep aft draft of 9.8M.  When the pilot heard the air draft readings it was determined that there was not enough air gap to proceed under the Corpus Christi Harbor Bridge because the maximum allowable air draft on a normal day was 42M.  The pilot explained that due to a coastal flood advisory and current tide gauge reading the vessel would make contact with the bridge and the pilot ordered the vessel back to anchorage where it was to conduct de-ballasting operations to reduce the air draft as much as possible.  The pilot also advised the master to request the new pilotage time as near as possible to the next predictable low tide the following day.  \n\nOn the day of the incident a new pilot was dispatched to the STAR HELENA and the master reported the air draft at 41.55M with an aft deep draft of 10.25M.  The pilot determined that with a 41.55M air draft and the negative tide reading that the vessel would pass the bridge without incident.  The inbound transit proceeds without issue until the vessel reached the Corpus Christi Harbor Bridge where it made contact with the bridge.  The vessel sustained minor damage which included the INMARSAT C unit and superficial mast damage.  The vessel transited safely to its berth with no further incident.  The INMARSAT C unit was rendered inoperable because of the impact.  The vessel was able to submit a request for a new unit and it was installed prior a scheduled annual FFVE on the 23rd of January.

After mooring in Seaford, Delaware the crew inspected the barge for damage with negative results other than minor paint scrapes.  \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision with the bridge fendering system. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) Inexperience of the Mate Pilot, (2)Lack of daylight hindering visibility, and (3)Strong flood tide impacting vessel's track. Recommend no further remedial or enforcement action for apparent violations of current law or regulation, inadequacies with the performance of Coast Guard personnel or representative or employee of any other government agency or any other person, or inadequacies with existing laws or regulations."}
{"activity_id":7643446,"brief":"On February 20, 2023, at approximately 1526, the ITV TEMPLE HUCKABEE (537180) was pushing ahead eight (8) loaded hopper barges along the Tombigbee River.  Upon approaching the Nahoela Bridge the Master set up a flanking maneuver, but encountered an unexpected strong current causing the tow to slow.  The Master eventually realized that the starboard string was not going to clear the bridge piling so he placed the throttle in full astern in an effort to lessen the impact with the bridge pillars.  \n\nThe starboard lead barge made contact with the bridge piling causing multiple barge lines to part.  The Master then positioned the tow up river to replace the parted wires.  Once the wires were replaced by the crew, the vessel and accompanying tow proceeded to the intended destination.  No damage was noted to the bridge.  \n\nAs a result of its investigation the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of the ITV TEMPLE HUCKABEE starboard lead barge and the Nahoela Bridge.

{"activity_id":7650243,"brief":"On December 28, 2022, HARVEY PIONEET (O.N. 1218417), an inspected OSV, was inbound the Biloxi Bay to moor up at the Gulf Harvey Shipyard.  As the vessel approching the I-110 Biloxi bridge, the master attempted to contact the bridge tender, but did not recieve a response. The bridge is manned from 0500 to 2100 to open the spans for large commercial vessel. Due to its large vertical clearance of 61 ft, the operation of span openings are infrequent. The master believed he had enough clearance to proceed under the bridge, he directed the crew to lower the mast, but did not have the antennaes lowered. Another HARVEY vessel heard the HARVEY PIONEER's unsuccessful radio attempts and called the bridge via cell phone to advise them of the inbound vessel. The bridge tender took the information and stated that no radio attempts were made to open the bridge. While on the phone, the bridge tender looked out the window to get visibility on the inbound vessel and found the vessel transitting under the bridge and the antennaes make contact with girder #4. HARVEY PIONEER continued it's transit to Gulf Harvey Shipyard and upon arrival found the antennas broken. Repairs were made and a report was given to the company.\n\nThe bridge tender filed a report of the allision to Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) and an initial assessment was done. Strike marks along the top of the bridge were found, but otherwise functional. The bridge tender continued with the next two bridge openings of that day without issue. However, the following bridge opening on January 2, 2023, the pins to secure the span stopped midway and the bridge tender had to mannually drive the pins in place. On January 5, 2023, the bridge tender attempted to raise the spans, but pins would not engage. The bridge tender placed the system in manual mode and attempted to manually drive the pins, but was unsuccessful. The bridge tender reported the issue to the MDOT, who notified the CG the bridge was closed to marine traffic until the surveyor assessed the issue and conduct repairs.\n\nThrough its investigation the Coast Guard has determined the initiating event for this casualty was the bridge allision. Causal factors contributing to this casualty include the master's failure to schedule a bridge opening."}

The allision also caused several towing wires to break, causing the tow to separate from the towing vessel. Some of the broken towing wires became entangled in the propellers of ARLENE, rendering the propulsion system inoperable. The vessel and its tow were recovered and moved out of the way of downbound traffic to the right descending bank to assess damages. Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development reported that the Highway 190 Bridge incurred no damage.\n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the tow of ARLENE and the Highway 190 Bridge, which caused the subsequent events of hull damage to EMS 3021 and EMS 393, flooding of the stern void of EMS 393, fouling of propulsion shafts of ARLENE, a reduction in propulsion of ARLENE, and the setting adrift of the barges from ARLENE's tow. The causal factors to this casualty include: 1) Swift current caused by \"High Water\" conditions near the Highway 190 Bridge; 2) The use of the center span to navigate under the Highway 190 bridge due to the perceived navigation impediment of the dock below the Baton Rouge span of the bridge; and 3) the Master misjudged the degree to which the tow would \"slide\" and align with the center span of Highway 190 Bridge."}

The vessel was upbound and was pushing two barges loaded with 54,865 barrels of gasoline (total) strung out. The Master was making the approach to moor the tug and tow at the Marathon Petroleum Company Midland (MPC) facility at the time of the incident. \n\nRiver gage at Montgomery Lock and Dam was at approximately 13.3 feet and river current was approximately 2-3 mph in the area at the time of the incident. Master of TEXAS CITY was trying to overcome the current and the vessel entered slack water near the dock. The Master realized that he had too much headway while on approach to MPC Midland dock and started backing full astern. He flanked the stern out to swing the head of the tow to the port toward the dock in effort to avoid the bridge pier. The starboard bow KIRBY 28053 made contact with the right descending bridge pier at .5 mph. Two of the port tow wires broke upon contact but the two starboard tow wires held the tow together. The lower end of the bridge pier had broken concrete and the barge had a 3 inch wide vertical dent the height of the head log on the starboard bow with paint removal from the area of the dent. MSU Pittsburgh Duty Marine Inspector, Pollution Investigator, Duty Investigating Officer and a break-in responded to the incident to conduct damage survey and investigate incident.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of the KIRBY 28053 with the Midland Shippingport Highway Bridge pier.

{"activity_id":7666427,"brief":"Sector Long Island Sound Command Center received a report from the U.S. Navy regarding a bridge allision involving the vessel HOS ROSEBUD (1323239). The HOS ROSEBUD was transiting the Thames River outbound from the Navy Sub Base in Groton, CT when the vessel's mast contacted the underside of the raised Thames River AMTRAK railroad bridge. No damage to the bridge was reported; the vessel suffered damage only to the mast and associated equipment.\n\nThe HOS ROSEBUD is an inspected offshore supply vessel, under Military Sealift Command contract to the U.S. Navy. It is owned and operated by Hornbeck Offshore Services, LLC of Covington, Louisiana. \n\nThe Thames River AMTRAK railroad bridge is a moveable bridge equipped with a vertical lift mechanism. As per 33 C.F.R. 117.224, the bridge will open on signal to a height of 75 feet above mean high water for all vessel traffic unless a full bridge opening to 135.3 feet above mean high water is requested.\n\nThe weather on the morning of April 6, 2023 had fog with visibility of less than 1.4 mile; air temperature 48 degrees F, and calm winds. \n\nOn April 6, 2023 at 7:30 a.m., a Naval Ship Pilot (DoD Employee) boarded the HOS ROSEBUD at the Navy Sub Base pier in Groton, CT, intending to take the vessel outbound via the Thames River, ultimately bound for Norfolk, VA. The Pilot discussed his transit plan with the Master of the vessel. Visibility that morning was approximately 200 yards due to fog. The Pilot requested the air draft for the vessel; the Master produced the Pilot Card which listed the air draft at 20.6 meters (67.8 feet). The Pilot did some quick math and determined the air draft was approximately 68 feet. He told the Master that he would request the Thames River AMTRAK railroad bridge be opened to 90 feet so that he could still see the bridge lights to assist in lining up the ship in the center of the opening. The Master agreed with the plan and began making preparations to get the vessel underway. The Pilot made a telephone call to the Bridge Tender and asked for an opening of 90 feet, and provided an estimated time of request for the opening. As the HOS ROSEBUD got closer to the bridge, the Pilot called the AMTRAK Bridge Tender on VHF Channel 13 and requested an opening for 90 feet. They agreed upon the time of the opening and the HOS ROSEBUD proceeded to make their way toward the bridge. At approximately 8:45 a.m., they passed under the bridge at a speed between 5 to 6 knots when the top of the mast struck the underside of the bridge. After passing through, the Pilot held his position and had the vessel crew perform a quick safety survey. The vessel crew reported the mast was bent aft and some equipment mounted on the mast appeared damaged. The Pilot spoke with the Bridge Tender who reported there was no damage to the bridge. The Pilot proceeded to anchorage off New London and completed the accident notifications.\n\nUpon closer examination, the Pilot Card listed the air draft as 20.6 meters. However, this did not include the height of the mast. The definition of air draft is the measurement from the waterline to the highest point on the vessel. The air draft on the Pilot Card only measured from the waterline to the top of the Pilot House.\n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this marine casualty was the allision of the HOS ROSEBUD's mast with the underside of the Thames River AMTRAK railroad bridge. The causal factors which contributed to this casualty include: 1) the incorrect listing of the air draft of the HOS ROSEBUD on the Pilot Card; 2) the heavy fog conditions; and 3) the Pilot's request for a less-than-full opening of the bridge."}

{"activity_id":7676752,"brief":"On February 4, 2023, at about 12:00 CST, the uninspected towing vessel MISS GLENDA was pushing ahead two spud barges, WLV-3 and Spud Barge 1701, near the intersection of the ICW MM 95 and Atchafalaya River.  This area is just south of the tri-bridge complex near Morgan City, LA.  As the tow was nearing the intersection, the Berwick Bay Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) watch supervisor noticed the tow in the area, but that it was not displaying an AIS signal.  The watch supervisor and watch stander utilized a video camera to observe the vessel and saw that it was a towing vessel with spud barges. Over the next several minutes, a VTS Berwick Bay watch stander began communicating with the MISS GLENDA. The MISS GLENDA wheelman was asked to provide his air draft.  The wheelman gave various answers, four and six feet, and eventually stated he had four feet of clearance.  The MISS GLENDA was cleared to transit north through the tri-bridge complex based on the information the MISS GLENDA wheelman provided. At approximately 1206, the MISS GLENDA reported to VTS BERWICK BAY that its spud barge was stuck on the Highway 182 Bridge.  The watch stander asked again about the tow\u2019s air draft.  At that time, the wheelman stated 55 feet, which was not the information provided earlier in the transit.  \n\nThe MISS GLENDA was less than 26 feet and was not required to have an AIS onboard.  In addition, the wheelman was not required to be a credentialed mariner, and he had never operated a vessel in the Morgan City area before.  The wheelman showed investigators an application on his cell phone that he used for navigation.  When viewing the bridge height information, he wrongly looked at the nominal information for the bridge and not the actual height clearly listed on the display in the application.  Also, the wheelman stated he called a friend to ask about the bridge clearance, but that friend had never operated in the Morgan City area either.  Although the wheelman was in conversation with VTS, he never asked about the bridge height.  \n\nThe spud legs on the WLV-3 were bent following the allision with the bridge causing approximately $20,000.00 in damage.  The barge\u2019s spud legs were stuck under the bridge structure for about three to four hours.  The bridge was initially closed to traffic pending a survey, but it was not damaged.  \n\nDuring the investigation, Coast Guard investigators reviewed the traffic management of the Berwick Bay VTS and found several causal factors that contributed to this incident.  Those are listed below.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event was the allision of the lead spud barge, WLV-3, with the Highway 182 Bridge.  The causal factors that contributed to this incident include:\n\n1. The MISS GLENDA wheelman did not practice good seamanship and operated his vessel in a negligent manner. The wheelman did not use official charts for transiting the area \nOn February 4, 2023, at about 12:00 CST, the uninspected towing vessel MISS GLENDA was pushing ahead two spud barges, WLV-3 and Spud Barge 1701, near the intersection of the ICW MM 95 and Atchafalaya River.  This area is just south of the tri-bridge complex near Morgan City, LA.  As the tow was nearing the intersection, the Berwick Bay Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) watch supervisor noticed the tow in the area, but that it was not displaying an AIS signal.  The watch supervisor and watch stander utilized a video camera to observe the vessel and saw that it was a towing vessel with spud barges. Over the next several minutes, a VTS Berwick Bay watch stander began communicating with the MISS GLENDA. The MISS GLENDA wheelman was asked to provide his air draft.  The wheelman gave various answers, four and six feet, and eventually stated he had four feet of clearance.  The MISS GLENDA was cleared to transit north through the tri-bridge complex based on the information the MISS GLENDA wheelman provided. At approximately 1206, the MISS GLENDA reported to VTS BERWICK BAY that its spud barge was stuck on the Highway 182 Bridge.  The watch stander asked again about the tow\u2019s air draft.  At that time, the wheelman stated 55 feet, which was not the information provided earlier in the transit.  \n\nThe MISS GLENDA was less than 26 feet and was not required to have an AIS onboard.  In addition, the wheelman was not required to be a credentialed mariner, and he had never operated a vessel in the Morgan City area before.  The wheelman showed investigators an application on his cell phone that he used for navigation.  When viewing the bridge height information, he wrongly looked at the nominal information for the bridge and not the actual height clearly listed on the display in the application.  Also, the wheelman stated he called a friend to ask about the bridge clearance, but that friend had never operated in the Morgan City area either.  Although the wheelman was in conversation with VTS, he never asked about the bridge height.  \n\nThe spud legs on the WLV-3 were bent following the allision with the bridge causing approximately $20,000.00 in damage.  The barge\u2019s spud legs were stuck under the bridge structure for about three to four hours.  The bridge was initially closed to traffic pending a survey, but it was not damaged.  \n\nDuring the investigation, Coast Guard investigators reviewed the traffic management of the Berwick Bay VTS and found several causal factors that contributed to this incident.  Those are listed below.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event was the allision of the lead spud barge, WLV-3, with the Highway 182 Bridge.  The causal factors that contributed to this incident include:\n\n1. The MISS GLENDA wheelman did not practice good seamanship and operated his vessel in a negligent manner. The wheelman did not use official charts for transiting the area and instead utilized a phone application. While using the application, he was not knowledgeable on what information meant in the display.  \n\n2. The MISS GLENDA wheelman was not familiar with the Morgan City area and had never operated a vessel there before. He was accustomed to operating upon the Mississippi River near New Orleans where bridge heights are much higher.  Radio communications revealed the wheelman\u2019s lack of knowledge on navigation requirements for the area.  At times, other vessels directed the wheelman on who to call for assistance and his location.\n\n3. The MISS GLENDA wheelman provided false information regarding his tow characteristics. While in transit, the wheelman called a friend to get bridge height information instead of asking VTS, who he was having an active conversation with, and provided the wrong air draft height several times.  It is not known if the misinformation was intentional or if he did not understand the meaning of air draft. \n\n4. Prior to reporting for watch, the VTS watch stander was in a fatigued state. The watch stander had just returned from leave in Puerto Rico and drove in from Tampa, FL, the night before. The watch stander stated English is their second language and it was hard to understand radio communications on the day of the incident, especially after being in an area recently where only Spanish was spoken. The watch stander admitted to being \u201csuper tired\u201d while on watch. \n\n5.  The watch stander failed to recognize a developing traffic conflict, failed to recognize obvious inaccurate information regarding air draft, failed to request assistance from the watch supervisor when struggling with tasking, and failed to recognize the MISS GLENDA was not familiar with the area. This may be due to the watch stander\u2019s inability to hear channel 13 communications, inability to process and understand the situation due to fatigue and\/or experience, or lack of knowledge\/experience. The VTS internal operating procedures requires the watch stander to monitor channels 11 and 13.  The watch stander stated that when listening to channel 11 with a headset on, it is difficult to hear channel 13.  The channel 13 speaker was located away from the watch stander. Therefore, the watch stander did not hear the conversations of the MISS GLENDA wheelman speaking to other vessels, all being conducted on channel 13.\n\n6.  The watch supervisor did not have all information regarding the MISS GLENDA and therefore was unaware of the ongoing issues regarding its transit and vessel characteristics.  \na. The watch supervisor did not hear radio communications on channel 11. The watch supervisor desk has one radio speaker and that was turned to channel 13.  The watch supervisor directed the watch stander on several occasions to obtain information about the MISS GLENDA.  However, since the watch stander was using a headset to listen to channel 11, the watch supervisor could not hear the radio communication.  All calls with VTS were on channel 11.  All calls with other vessels were on channel 13.   \nb. The watch supervisor gave direct orders to the watch stander, which were not always immediately followed. The watch supervisor expected that directions to the watch stander were followed and all appropriate information was obtained.  \nc. The watch supervisor and watch stander had different experience levels and viewed the traffic situation in the VTS area differently. This led to the watch supervisor\u2019s over reliance on the watch stander\u2019s qualification ability.  The watch stander had only been qualified for six months and felt the traffic in the area at that time was a lot to handle.  \nd.  As the situation developed, the watch supervisor was handling another issue on the telephone and was not able to closely follow the situation.\n\n7. The Berwick Bay VTS internal operating procedures did not provide adequate instruction on the watch duties and responsibilities.\n\nNote: Failure to monitor radio communications was a causal factor in a previous incident. On January 14, 2023, the ITV LIBERTY and ITV TEENIE SONIER had a near collision when the TEENIE SONIER failed to give proper clearance to the LIBERTY. Both vessels had a verbal altercation on channel 13 prior to meeting. In that situation, neither the watch stander nor watch supervisor intervened in the situation that was clearly developing by the holding TEENIE SONIER\u2019s refusal to move out of the path of the down bound LIBERTY.  See IIA # 7652464.\n\n\nThis investigation was conducted at the standard level as per INV Policy 02-22"}

The SUSAN K was transiting southbound on the lower Mississippi River, near mile marker 363, pushing 25 loaded barges. At the time of the incident there were 9 persons on board the vessel.\n\nThe Master originally intended to pass through the navigable bridge span closer to the right descending bank.  When he found that his vessel was out of position to safely pass through the span closer to the right descending bank, he made the judgement call to pass through the navigable span closer to the left descending bank. He was not successful in passing through the span on the left descending bank and his tow, specifically the SCF 24145B allided with the bridge piling. \n\nTwo other barges were damaged because of the bridge allision. The two other damaged barges were the SCF 11133B and the SCF 14119B. Both the SCF 11133B and the SCF 14119B stayed afloat with the assistance of dewatering equipment. In total, 3 of the 25 barges were damaged and the estimated damages was $550,000.\n\nAs a result of its investigation the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was allision between the SUSAN K\u2019s tow and the Natchez\/Vidalia Hwy 80 Bridge. This was followed by the tow breaking apart and the sinking of the SCF 24145B barge. The casual factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the Master of the SUSAN K was complacent and (2) Navigating at night reduces visibility."}

ITV was pushing 15 dry cargo barges, 14 loaded with fertilizer and 01 empty. Transiting upriver river, the vessel maneuvered under the bridge. The Master \"pulled back\" several times to align the tow with the span to safely transit. As the COOPERATIVE VANGUARD slowly maneuvered through the span, the master stated the water conditions were making it difficult and required many corrections. The barges cleared the span and protections cell and as the vessel came parallel to the protection cell the vessel rubbed the timbers. The Sabula Railroad Bridge and the COOPERATIVE VANGUARD both reported no visible damage to the vessel or bridge.\n\nMSD Quad Cities determined the initiating event for this marine casualty to be the high water stage and subsequent increased current speed. The vessel took precaution and several attempts to line up the tow while acclimating to the current speed and power. Sabula Railroad Bridge remains operational. 15 dry cargo barges, undamaged."}

{"activity_id":7746811,"brief":"Sector Long Island Sound received notification from the Old Lyme\/Old Saybrook AMTRAK railroad Bridge Tender that a work boat with a crane fixed to the aft work deck struck the bridge. The vessel, CT8712BF, was transiting southbound under the bridge when the crane, which was extended and upright at a 45-degree angle to the deck, struck the underside of the bridge. Bridge Inspectors determined there was no damage to the bridge and it was safe for rail traffic. The crane on the work boat suffered scrapes and a broken hydraulic line which discharged approximately 2 gallons of hydraulic fluid into the Connecticut River.\n\nPrior to the incident, the crew on the work boat had been preparing a swim platform to be delivered to Point-O-Woods Beach in Old Lyme. They were using the deck-mounted crane to work on and place the floating swim platform on the aft deck and secure it for the trip. The crew left the vessel for lunch, and when they returned, they failed to retract the 2 boom extensions prior to getting underway. The vessel needed to transit south through the Old Lyme\/Old Saybrook AMTRAK railroad bridge which spans the Connecticut River in order to get to Point-O-Woods Beach.  The clearance with the bridge in the closed position is approximately 18 feet. The Operator on the workboat did not need to request an opening because the air draft of the work boat is approximately 13 feet when the crane is secured and completely retracted. Recent heavy rains caused the Connecticut River to crest over flood stage, resulting in a great deal of large debris floating in the river. The Operator and his crew members were focused on identifying and avoiding floating debris and all failed to notice the crane was extended and upright when the vessel departed the South Yard Marina. As the Operator attempted to transit under the bridge, the crane's boom extension hung up on the underside of the bridge, halting the workboat's forward progress. The Operator immediately reversed engines while a crew member lowered the crane boom. The crew member could not retract the boom extensions because a hydraulic line had been severed when the boom struck the bridge. The vessel safely returned to the South Yard Marina where the crew used sorbent pads to remove the hydraulic oil from the boat's aft deck and the surface of the Connecticut River.\n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the CT8712BF and the AMTRAK railroad bridge over the Connecticut River in Old Lyme. This was followed by a small hydraulic oil discharge caused by a severed hydraulic line on the crane boom. The causal factor that contributed to this casualty was the Operator's hyper-focus on the flooding status of the Connecticut River and his failure to notice the crane was fully extended and upright at a 45-degree angle from the deck prior to getting underway."}

{"activity_id":7771495,"brief":"At 0315 local on 19 June 2023, the Inspected Towing Vessel (ITV) BARBARA LIND while pushing the Barge 201 (O.N 503918), allided with the fendering system of the Highway 37 Bridge across the Petaluma River. The operator reported that he misjudged the  set and drift of the vessel and failed to correct in time, striking the fendering system of the bridge. There were no injuries to the crew and no damage to the barge or vessel as a result of the allision, however the fendering system of the Highway 37 Bridge sustained damage as a result of the incident. \n\nThe tug and barge continued to their destination without further incident. The bridge remained open for marine traffic and highway service.  Damage was initially estimated to be in the range of $200,000 for repairs however, that estimate could not be verified due to documented pre-existing damage of the barge fendering system. CALTRANS, the operator of the bridge was unable to validate what damage was pre-exisiting and what was caused directy from the incident involving the BARBARA LIND and Barge 201. \n\nThe Captain and deckhand on watch conducted post casualty drug and alcohol testing.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the vessels allision with the bridge. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) Human error in the production mode in the form of a misjudgement of the approach and failing to account for set and drift.\n\nAs a separate finding, The Captain of the Tug stated that lights on the bridge were not operational which impacted his ability to gauge distances upon approach. The Investigating Officer liased with U.S. Coast Guard District Eleven Bridges Division and the investigation did not find any evidence of faulty lights or equipment on the bridge. \n\nSee PACII activity for USCG follow up actions."}
{"activity_id":7774134,"brief":"The inspected passenger vessel SABINO was southbound in the Mystic Harbor approaching the Mystic River Highway (Bascule) bridge. The Master of the SABINO noted the bridge was open and slowed to allow northbound vessel traffic through the opening. Once all the vessel traffic had cleared, he proceeded to approach the bridge, and was committed to going through. The Master saw the bridge began to close. He called to the Bridge Tender to ask if he would keep it open. The Bridge Tender replied \"yes\". The SABINO Master did not make another radio call to the Bridge Tender to confirm the bridge span would remain open or be stopped in place to permit the SABINO to pass through safely. The Master brought SABINO through the bridge as it continued to close. As the SABINO passed under the closing span, the underside of the bridge caught on the SABINO's stern flagpole, breaking it off. There was no other damage to the vessel. There was no damage to the bridge. There were no injuries to any passengers on board SABINO.\n\nThe Bridge Tender for the Mystic River Highway Bridge operates the bridge openings\/closings from the house located on the south side of the bridge. When standing, the Bridge Tender can see both north and south-bound river traffic. When seated, his view to the north is obstructed. From May 1 to October 31, the bridge is raised for vessel traffic at 40 minutes past the hour from 7:40 a.m. to 6:40 p.m. From 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., the bridge is opened on demand. The Bridge Tender admitted to being seated when the SABINO was approaching the bridge opening and did not admit to responding over the radio that he would keep the bridge open for the SABINO's passing. A video recording of the passage made by a crew member standing just outside the wheelhouse recorded the SABINO's Master confirm that the bridge would remain open, and the Bridge Tender is heard to respond \"yes\".\n\nAs a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined the initiating event for this casualty was the span of the Mystic River Highway Bridge making contact with the SABINO's flagpole, resulting in breaking the flagpole off the vessel. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the Bridge Tender's failure to maintain visual awareness of the area of the Mystic River just below the closing span of the bridge while the bridge was closing; (2) inadequate communications between the Bridge Tender and the Master of the SABINO."}
{"activity_id":7782072,"brief":"On June 13, 2023, at about 13:10 CST, the Inspected Towing Vessel (ITV) LOW LAND 5 was underway pushing ahead one spud barge, LL35-160, north bound along the Lower Atchafalaya River between the Morgan City Bridges when the barge\u2019s two spud legs unintentionally grounded.  The spud legs were grounded for about 45 minutes.  \n\nThe tow got underway from the mile marker 75 of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) and was heading to the Bayou Sorrel Lock to get some equipment to bring back to Houma for a job. The barge\u2019s dimensions were 165 feet long by 35 feet wide.  As the vessel was only a 12-hour boat, the crew consisted of only 2 people, the master, and a deckhand.\n\nInvestigation revealed the spud legs were in the up position, 65 feet above the water\u2019s surface.  The tow cleared the Morgan City Railroad Bridge and the Hwy 90 Bridge, both have a 73-foot clearance.  Then, the spud legs were lowered 20 feet to clear the Hwy 182 Bridge height of only 50 feet.   After the spud legs slightly dragged bottom, the vessel\u2019s captain raised the spud legs 5 feet.  Then, the hydraulic motor to the spud legs ran out of fuel. With the spud leg locking pins out, and the spud leg motor out of fuel, the spud legs dropped and grounded.\n\nThe empty 30-gallon diesel fuel tank to the hydraulic pump motor was filled.  The hydraulic pump motor was re-started, and the barge\u2019s two spud legs were raised to the desired height to not drag bottom, but still clear the Hwy 182 Bridge.  The tow proceeded on without incident.  It was reported the spud legs were not bent or damaged.   \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event was the barge\u2019s spud legs grounded.  The casual factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the spud leg\u2019s air height of 65 feet, which was too high to clear the Hwy 182 air gap of only 50 feet; (2) the diesel fuel tank to the spud leg\u2019s lift motor ran out of fuel causing the spud legs to drop and ground; (3) the spud leg\u2019s locking pins were out at the time allowing the spud legs to drop and ground."}
{"activity_id":7789329,"brief":"On September 9, 2023, while underway in the Charles River, the inspected small passenger vessel LONGFELLOW BRIDGET's alternator failed. The vessel lost propulsion following the failure of the alternator when the battery was discharged. The LONGFELLOW BRIDGET was towed in by another duck boat and the passengers were disembarked ashore without further incident.\n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the failure of the main diesel engine's alternator, which led to a loss of propulsion. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the failure of the alternator, (2) depletion of electrical charge in the main diesel engine's service battery, and (3) loss of electrical power to the main diesel engine."}

{"activity_id":7153208,"brief":"On February 8, 2021, the towing vessel MISS KATELYN departed the Martin Fuel Docks near Morgan City, LA, with the empty spud barges YVONNE and DOIRON en route to Grassy Lake.  The tow started heading west along the Bayou Shaffer and then turned north on the Atchafalaya River.  Almost immediately after the tow turned north on the River, it approached the Bayou Boeuf Rail Road Bridge travelling at approximately 1 knot.  As the tow was passing under the bridge, crewmembers stated that the wind caught the lead barge DOIRON.  This in turn caused the port quarter of the barge to allide with the east bridge fender.  A nearby weather station observed winds blowing around 7 knots and gusting to 14 knots around the time of the allision.  There was no observed damage to either barge and there was some minor damage to wood on the fender.  This damage was not repaired.   There was no report of injuries or pollution.  The vessel was allowed to continue its transit with no operational restrictions.  \n\nAs a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event of this marine casualty is the allision between the spud barge DOIRON and the Bayou Boeuf Rail Road Bridge fender.  The causal factors that led to this incident are as follows:\n\n1) Winds blowing between 10-15 knots that pushed the DOIRON into the fender."}
