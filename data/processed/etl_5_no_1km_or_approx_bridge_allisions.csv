The BARBARA ANN was intending to back down through the Sunshine Bridge and then top around in the river below the bridge.  As the vessel was falling with the current, the tow started to swing out and the Captain decided to let it continue to swing and attempted to top around above the bridge, instead of below like originally planned. At approximately 1115, the port bow of the lead barge (K29051) made contact with the center span of the Sunshine Bridge. 

The K29051 sustained damage to the port head log. The wooden fender on the bridge pier was damaged and a small scrape was observed in the cement. 

As a result of its investigation the Coast Guard determined the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the K29501 and the Sunshine Bridge pier. This was followed by the damage to the barge and the bridge fender system.  The casual factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the Lower Mississippi River being in a major flood stage causing stronger river currents and dynamic eddies and (2) the Master's incorrect assessment of how much distance the tow would need to clear the bridge pier.

NUNLEY Loss of Steering/Allision,"On February 13, 2020, the ITV CAPT. W.D. NUNLEY (O.N. 1225575), was travelling north on the Ohio River enroute to Bellaire, OH, pushing 15 general barges loaded with various cargoes.  As the tow entered a bend near mile marker 246, the Captain began steering to port but noticed the rudder indicator showed the rudder hard to starboard.  The Captain switched to the backup steering pump with no change.  Steering was switched to non-follow-up and the rudder responded properly.  However, due to high water conditions, oncoming current, and the steering loss the tow continued to drift and eventually the head of the tow struck the bank.  After the head of the tow struck the bank, nine of the 15 barges broke free and drifted down the river.  

Following the casualty, the Captain examined the steering system and found that the follow-up steering shaft manual limit pin was missing.  This pin was replaced on-scene and all steering capabilities returned to the vessel.  The CAPT. W.D. NUNLEY then proceeded to gather the barges that had broken free without further incident.  

After the barges broke free, the CAPT. W.D. NUNLEY began the process of retrieving its barges.  It was reported some of the barges drifted approximately 10 miles downriver until secured.   Several Good Samaritan vessels assisted in securing the barges.  It was reported that one barge struck the Pomeroy-Mason Bridge near mile marker 251.3.  Due to darkness, no one physically saw the barge make contact, but heard what sounded like something hitting the bridge.  Two property owners in Pomeroy, OH, area reported minor damage to their property from the drifting barges.
  
As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the loss of steering due to the pin falling out of the follow-up steering shaft manual limit.  This caused the tow to subsequently strike the bank and nine of the 15 barges to break free.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty are:

1. A cotter pin that was supposed to hold the missing pin in place apparently failed causing the pin to fall out.  However, the CAPT. W.D. NUNLEY had been on its current voyage for approximately four days without any known incidents.  The company immediately conducted verification checks on all vessels with similar steering systems to ensure the pins were properly in place and secure.  In addition, the company instituted policy changes for crews to conduct routine checks of the pin on all vessels with similar systems.

There were no injuries, pollution, or other damage.  The Coast Guard did not attend the towing vessel or barges and no restrictions were placed on the towing vessel's movements.",['Pomroy-Mason Highway Bridge']

The vessel was transiting north from Belle River, LA to Amelia, LA when the starboard bow allided with the wood fendering system of the railroad bridge. The vessel was going approximately 0.2 mph when it allided with the fendering system. The bridge tender that witnessed the allision noted that the vessel was not properly lined up in the channel prior to entering, which caused the port bow of the barge to allide with the fendering system. The vessel then pivoted off the pilings to straighten up the tow to continue through the bridge system. The Bayou Boeuf Railroad bridge has a horizontal span of 56 feet. There was no report of any damages to the barge and minimal damage to one of the wooden planks of the fendering system. There was no report of any injuries or pollution as a result of this incident.

The master of the ITV FRED A SETTOON did not report the allision to the Coast Guard as required by 46 C.F.R. 4.05-1. He did notify the company, Settoon Construction, whom also did not report it to the Coast Guard. Upon further questioning, the company representative stated that he was not aware of the protocols for notifying the Coast Guard after the incident having just started working for the company. Both the mariner and the company have a history of not reporting reportable marine casualties to the Coast Guard and further enforcement will be initiated for both parties.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the deck barge SCOTT A SETTOON JR and the Bayou Boeuf Railroad Bridge fendering system. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:
1) The miscalculation of the master in maneuvering the ITV FRED A SETTOON prior to transiting through the railroad bridge that resulted in the barge not being properly lined up.
2) The narrow horizontal clearance of the Bayou Boeuf Railroad bridge that reduces the range for error in maneuvering through the bridge with a tow.",['Bayou Boeuf Railroad Bridge Morgan City']

The vessel, deck barge, and spud barge as a single unit had drifted south from the Shallow Water Equipment Dock some time during the previous night. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that although the spud barge had been spudded down, there was not enough slack in the line after the yard workers checked on the spuds the evening prior to account for the tidal influence. There was both an increase in the volume of water flowing down though the Bayou Boeuf railroad bridge, in addition to a tidal variance according to the data collected from the USGS. Since there was not enough room in the lines for the spuds to adjust to the changing water levels, the spuds got detached from the river floor and started to drift out into the channel with the attached vessel THE DOMINO. With the increase in water flowing down from the north, THE DOMINO, deck barge, and spud barge drifted in the channel until it came to stop after alliding with the railroad bridge. The allision with the bridge did not result in any damages to either the structure, the towing vessel, or barges.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the breakaway of the spud barge from the dock. This was followed by THE DOMINO, deck barge, and spud barge to be adrift in the waterway that led to the eventual allision with the Bayou Boeuf Railroad Bridge. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:

1) The improperly spudded down spud barge that did not have enough slack to account for tidal variance and resulted in the vessel and barges to be set adrift in the waterway.
2) The lack of monitoring or notifications to personnel ashore to alert them of the vessel and barges becoming unsecured and drifting into the waterway prior to it finding its way down to the railroad bridge.

The vessel was returning from the Bayou Chene to the dock at Shallow Water Equipment in Amelia, LA pushing the deck barge loaded with two marsh buggies. As the captain was handling the vessel to make it through the west channel of the railroad bridge, he drove the barge straight into the middle of the center pier due to restricted visibility from THE DOMINO's bridge. The captain stated that he could not see the channel clearly due to the marsh buggies blocking his view and was utilizing the verbal cues from a lookout he had on the bow of the barge to maneuver. There were no radars or cameras installed onboard the towing vessel for the captain to utilize. The barge allided with the center pier at approximately 1.2 miles per hour and caused some minor damage to the sign and sign bracket costing around $1200. There was no damage reported on the barge. There was also no report of any injuries or pollution as a result of this incident. After the barge allided, the captain reversed and went through the eastern channel through the Bayou Boeuf Railroad bridge before stopping at the Shallow Water Equipment Dock. The duty team from MSU Morgan City arrived on-scene to further investigate the incident, but did not arrive prior to the marsh buggy being offloaded the barge. The vessel was still attached to the barge and only had a visual clearance of approximately 8 feet above the unloaded barge.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the deck barge being pushed by THE DOMINO and the Bayou Boeuf Railroad Bridge. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:
1) The size of the towing vessel THE DOMINO that did not provide enough visual clearance for the captain of the vessel to see past the marsh buggies on the deck barge it was pushing.
2) The low clearance height of the Bayou Boeuf Railroad Bridge combined with the increased water level that reduced the Master’s ability to see the structure from the low vantage point of THE DOMINO.

The vessel's deckhands were on the upper/aft portion of the pilot house (referred to as steel beach on board the vessel) to lower the vessels antennas prior to transiting under the bridge. As part of the vessel's standard operating procedures, the vessel's deckhands put all the antennas down with ample time prior to arrival at the bridge, with the exception of the Satellite Compass antenna, which stay up to ensure the vessel is able to maintain proper heading, until just before arrival at the bridge. The deckhand remains on the back of the pilot house until the vessel has passed under the bridge and puts the antennas back up. During this particular evolution, the deckhand had a trainee with him, and was distracted, showing her how to see the bridge through binoculars and forgot to put the last antenna down.
