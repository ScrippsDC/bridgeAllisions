6607357,40.6675,-89.61167,"At 2020 CST on January 07, 2019, the ITV ZEUS (O.N. 579001) allided with the Tazewell and Peoria Railroad drawbridge, known as the “Peoria Bridge”, at MM 161 on the Illinois River shearing off the top of the pilothouse and causing an oil spill of hydraulic oil into the Illinois River. The ZEUS was southbound pushing two empty anhydrous ammonia barges abreast (side by side).

Approximately 15 minutes prior to the allision, the master of the ZEUS had made VHF contact with the bridge tender, indicating they were southbound with two barges abreast. The bridge tender relayed that the bridge was up and the master of the ZEUS replied they were continuing south.  When the head of the ZEUS’s tow was approximately 100 yards upstream of the Peoria Bridge, the bridge tender announced twice on VHF 16 that they were intending to lower the bridge. The master of the ZEUS did not hear the callouts and only realized the bridge was being lowered when the bridge mounted channel centerline lights had changed from green to red. The Peoria Bridge tender did not hear the ZEUS master call out on VHF 16 inquiring if they were lowering the bridge on them. Simultaneously, the master of the ZEUS shifted both throttles to full astern but the effort was insufficient to stop the tow in time due to the ZEUS’s headway speed of approximately 6 knots and the close proximity to the bridge.  The master of the ZEUS remained in the pilothouse throughout the allision but only received minor injuries including small cuts and bruises, no other crewmembers sustained any injuries. Upon passing through the bridge, the master of the ZEUS was able to find the throttles amongst the debris and bring the main engines to neutral. The nearby fleeter ITV RIVER EAGLE observed the allision and immediately faced up to the ZEUS and safely maneuvered it to the adjacent bulkhead immediately south of the Peoria Bridge on the right descending bank. When the top of the ZEUS’s pilothouse carried aft along the vessel’s superstructure, it subsequently struck the hydraulic oil storage tank mounted on the aft deck of the 01 level, causing a rupture in the tank resulting in the spill of approximately three gallons.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of the ZEUS with the Peoria Bridge, which caused a temporary closure of the river to vessel traffic and a temporary closure of the bridge to rail traffic. This was followed by the resulting discharge of oil into the Illinois River. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the inappropriate lighting conditions in the bridge tender’s office, (2) the bridge tender’s failure to follow company policy resulting in a lack of situational awareness, (3) the bridge tender’s use of a bad rule to validate vessel traffic prior to lowering the bridge, and (4) the ZEUS’s master’s failure to hear VHF transmissions warning of lowering the bridge. It was determined that no reasonable defense existed which would have prevented the subsequent oil spill.

During the course of the investigation, the vessel representatives of the ZEUS updated the estimated costs of repairs from approximately $200,000 to a cost exceeding the $500,000 threshold for a major marine casualty. After discussion with CG-INV and Sector Upper Mississippi River, the investigation was kept at the informal level and NTSB was not notified due to the notification of the increased cost coming significantly later in the investigation.",IL,Peoria County,['ILLINOIS'],['TAZEWELL AND PEORIA RAILROAD DRAWBRIDGE'],"['KIRBY 23850', 'KIRBY 21853', 'ZEUS', 'RIVER EAGLE', 'PRAIRIE MOON']","40.6675,-89.61167"

The BARBARA ANN was intending to back down through the Sunshine Bridge and then top around in the river below the bridge.  As the vessel was falling with the current, the tow started to swing out and the Captain decided to let it continue to swing and attempted to top around above the bridge, instead of below like originally planned. At approximately 1115, the port bow of the lead barge (K29051) made contact with the center span of the Sunshine Bridge. 

The K29051 sustained damage to the port head log. The wooden fender on the bridge pier was damaged and a small scrape was observed in the cement. 

As a result of its investigation the Coast Guard determined the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the K29501 and the Sunshine Bridge pier. This was followed by the damage to the barge and the bridge fender system.  The casual factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the Lower Mississippi River being in a major flood stage causing stronger river currents and dynamic eddies and (2) the Master's incorrect assessment of how much distance the tow would need to clear the bridge pier.

As the Mate prepared for the transit through the North Landing Bridge, he reduced the speed of the tug and barge from 5 knots to 3 knots and directed the deckhand to the bow of the barge to serve as a lookout. The observed weather conditions were clear skies, with 15 MPH winds from the northeast, and occasional gust up to 17 MPH. As the tug and barge began to transit through the bridge, the bow of the DMT 405 began to fall to the port side and allided with the southeast woodpile fender.

A third party marine surveyor was hired to conduct a bridge assessment by the Army Corps of Engineers. It was determined that the fender ""wales"", which are wooden planks that were bolted horizontally across the woodpile cluster, were cracked and splintered. The red navigation light that was on top of the woodpile fender was knocked over, and rendered inoperable. The navigation light was replaced shortly after the incident. Sector Hampton Roads Investigators were provided with an estimate of $50,000 worth of damage to the bridge fender system. The DMT 405 suffered a 6 inch inset along the port bow rake knuckle approximately 4 feet above the waterline. It did not affect the barge's fitness for service.

As a result of the investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the improper vessel maneuver of the JULIA B by the Mate. The subsequent event was the DMT 405 allision with the woodpile fender. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) execution error-attention failure: the Mate failed to take early and substantial action to avoid the allision with the bridge fender system.

6624408,29.79254,-95.06183,"HOU2019/0043:On February 11, 2019, the master of the inspected towing vessel (ITV) LINDBERG CROSBY reported that his tow allided with the Interstate 10 Highway Bridge located over the San Jacinto River in Houston, Texas. The LINDBERG CROSBY tug is a 55-foot, 66 gross ton, twin screw towing vessel operated by the Crosby Marine Transportation Company.  The master initially reported he observed damage on the head log of the barge and substantial damage to at least one of the bridge supports on the westbound lanes of the highway. 

The master said he was approaching the bridge with the intent to moor at the Kirby’s Cleaning Fleet just south of the bridge. As he approached the bridge, he initiated a series of maneuvers using the throttle controls.  However, unknown to the master, the starboard engine remained clutched into forward propulsion, even though the master reversed to full astern propulsion. 

With the starboard engine unintentionally clutched forward, increased throttle demand for reverse power resulted in faster forward motion. The master attempted evasive maneuvers to steer the vessel clear of the bridge, but the bow rake head log struck the bridge support. The impact's force sheered the concrete pillar approximately 8' above the waterline. The allision halted the vessel's forward momentum. Upon looking aft, the master determined from the prop wash that the starboard engine was still engaged forward even though the throttles were in neutral. The master went to the engine room and found the air valve actuator linkage for the starboard clutch control disconnected, locking the vessel in forward control. The master reconnected the linkage and regained the clutch control of the starboard engine.
 
Damage to the barge resulted in a 1-foot wide by 2-inch deep inset on the forward external head log, internal structural deformation of stiffeners, and a damaged vent mast riser. The estimated total cost for repairs is $26,279. Repairs to the bridge's main structural supports are estimated to cost more than $1.5 million.

The U. S. Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board's joint investigation determined the cause of the casualty to be the failure of the marine gear actuator valve linkage. Possible causes for the failure of the actuator linkage include: shaft locking nut was not torqued to the proper specification, or during use, the shaft rotated in a counterclockwise direction effectively unscrewing from the opposing end linkage and disconnecting. Crosby Tugs has developed a more comprehensive inspection plan, including replacement of the actuator valves every 2.5 years in conjunction with the existing dry-dock schedule for each vessel within their fleet.

Due to the lack of set past Browns Point, the Trip Pilot made the decision to steer the Hwy 80 / Railroad Bridge, instead of flanking.  While the Trip Pilot was coming ahead on the engines in an attempt to bring the tow through Span 3 of the Hwy 80 / Railroad Bridge, the tow started to swing towards the east bank and at approximately 0711L the second barge out from the port string (CC-95507B) made contact with Pier 3 of the Hwy 80 / Railroad Bridge. 

The initial contact broke the couplings all the way across the tow allowing all 30 barges to break free. After all barges broke away the CC-95507B began to sink in the vicinity of Pier 3.

After the facing wire broke, the only thing keeping the JOHNNY SR connected to the tow was a loose starboard facing wire and a safety line that was tied to the bow. Soon after the facing wire break, the tow stopped turning to the port due to a wind coming from the port side. 

The JOHHNY SR and its tow drifted down river and the port stern of the port lead barge made contact with pier I of the Huey P. Long Bridge.

The master of the vessel reported the vessel experienced heavy currents and winds from the port side which caused a port-side winch wire and synthetic line connecting two barges to part.  After the parting of the port-side wire and line, the starboard side was subjected to increased forces that ultimately broke the starboard winch wire and line which resulted in the lead two barges separating from the tow and drifting down river unattended.

After the parting of the lead two barges, both the barges floated down river, under both bridges, and reportedly did not allide with either bridge.  Both of these barges floated downstream to approximately mile 13.8 of the Monongahela River before grounding along the right descending bank.  Meanwhile, the master of the PAUL MCGINNIS managed to navigate under the bridges with the single loaded barge, but made incidental contact (barge vs bridge) with the Union Railroad Bridge.  There was no damage observed to either the bridge or the barge.  Both grounded barges were recovered from downstream where they had grounded.  Checks were made of both grounded barges and one was found to have a slight leak, but suspect the leak to this uninspected barge was pre-existing and not related to the grounding.

The towing vessel was fitted with all required navigational equipment, and equipment was operational. Because the area of navigation was covered with dense fog, the navigational visibility was restricted to approximately 4.3 nautical miles. However, winds and sea conditions were calm/nominal. The Dulac Pontoon Bridge, in Dulac, LA, was in the closed position for vessel traffic. The bridge was fitted with navigational lights to alert of its location, and was fitted with sound devices operated by the bridge operator. All equipment on the bridge was operational. 

At approximately 0510, the bridge operator used the bridge’s sound device to produce one long blast to alert the vessel of the existence of a head-on/allision situation. After hearing the blast, using the navigational equipment onboard, the Mate realized the vessel was in close proximity to the bridge. The Mate placed the vessel in reverse to avoid the allision, but such action was not made in ample time.  At approximately 0515, the towing vessel allided with the Dulac Pontoon Bridge, with most of the impact being toward the West side of the bridge, shifting it to its port side. The abrupt pushing movement of the barge portion caused collateral damages to other components of the bridge, including the arms that control the bridge’s movements, supporting bars and brackets, and supporting wooden components. The KAREN KOBY experienced minor damages to the bow portion of the vessel. A marine surveyor from Central Maritime, L.L.C., inspected all damages; surveyor had an initial estimate of property damages to be approximately $100 for damages to the vessel, and approximately $175,000 for damages to the bridge. On May 1, 2019, Terrebonne Parish manager submitted an update on the cost of damages to the bridge, with a new cost estimate of $235,000.

The BRENDA L MURRAY II was upbound near mile marker 1 on the Monongahela River pushing 16 loaded coal barges.  The mate (pilot) of the BRENDA L MURRAY II reported the head of the tow was initially passing through the bridge span as planned, but the head of the tow was set to starboard more than anticipated by river current.  

Prior to the vessel's tow being set to starboard and the pilot finding himself in danger of alliding with a bridge, the pilot had requested the master come to the pilothouse for assistance during a mooring evolution several miles up river.  When the master arrived in the pilothouse he noticed the tow was being set to starboard, the master realized that nothing could be done to completely overcome the effects of the current, so he backed down and stopped the forward movement of the tow to minimize the effects up the impending allision.  With forward movement stopped, the forces of the current pushed the aft starboard barge onto the Liberty Bridge.  Once laid up alongside the bridge, the forces exerted by the current on the port side of the barges caused the lead 12 barges to breakaway completely from the tow and float downstream at the mercy of the current.  The bridge owners reported no significant damages sustained to any of the affected bridges.  All barges were eventually recovered and accounted for, however one barge sank (later recovered) and one barge partially sank (also recovered).  The vessel’s entire crew was tested for alcohol and dangerous drugs; all tests were found to be.  There were no injuries or pollution as a result of this marine casualty.  Damage estimates for the barges are ~ $300k as of 24MAY2019, though this is only an estimate, and final numbers will change as it could be months until all repairs are completed.

While attempting passage through the turning span, the starboard side of the barge allided with the bridge fixed pillar, causing the tug and barge to rotate, resulting in an allision of the towing vessel's port bow with the bridge's turning span.

The connecting wires broke with the impact and the TRS 2 was set adrift. The towing vessel, after the impact, was able to recover the barge and lay south of the bridge on the left descending bank (LDB) to assess damage. The TRS 2 was taking on water in 2 starboard voids. Dewatering pumps were keeping up with the water intrusion. The bridge’s turning span was inoperable and locked in the closed position due to the impact. The Coast Guard was immediately notified of the incident following its occurrence. Bridge surveyors dispatched by Union Pacific Railroad Company identified approximately $500,000 in damages that resulted in the bridge's closure to both marine and rail traffic due to misalignment of the turning span.""  

As a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the loss of control of the EDNA T GATTLE and its tow as it attempted passage through the Krotz Springs Bridge’s turning span. This was followed by the subsequent Allision, damage to the bridge's turning span and barge, and barge breakaway.

JACKSON, owned by the Interlake Steamship Company, was down-bound on the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, OH when the vessel's masthead light struck the Norfolk Southern Railroad Bridge (NS1) near the entrance to the river. Approximately 6 inches of the masthead light struck the bridge. The allision caused no damage to the bridge and only minor damage to the vessel's equipment, requiring the masthead light to be replaced. No injuries, pollution or other casualties resulted from this incident. 

The NS1 bridge is a vertical lift bridge that when in the lifted position has a vertical clearance of 98 feet as measured from the low water datum established at 569.2 feet (above sea level). At the time of the casualty the water level was observed to be 574.57 feet (or 5.37 feet above the low water datum); this lowered the relative clearance height of the bridge to 92.63 feet above the water. The vessel at the time of the casualty was calculated to have an air draft of 91.53 feet above the water, therefore giving the vessel an estimated clearance of just over 13 inches. The vessel's air draft is calculated using the fixed total height of the vessel from the keel to the masthead light which is 110.28 feet; the vessel's draft is then subtracted from the total height to give the above water height of the vessel (air draft). At the time of the casualty the vessel's draft was estimated to be 18.75 feet. The vessel's draft is estimated by the loading condition of the vessel including cargo and ballast and confirmed by reading the draft marks on the sides of the vessel. 

As a result of its investigation, the U.S. Coast Guard determined the cause of the casualty was the decision to load the vessel to the point that the vessel would only have approximately 13 inches of clearance under the NS1 bridge. This left very little room for any errors including in estimating the draft of the vessel, the water levels at the time the vessel was to proceed under the bridge, or even rounding errors. In reality the vessel had negative 6 inches of clearance under the NS1 bridge or a total error of 19 inches from what was the assumed to be the clearance based on calculations.",OH,Cuyahoga County,['Cuyahoga River'],['Norfolk Southern Cleveland Drawbridge No'],['HERBERT C JACKSON'],"41.50003,-81.70898"

The vessel topped around adjacent to the dock and made its approach to the Sunshine Bridge from the west bank side of the river. As the vessel made its approach it was unable to gain the necessary speed through the water to safely maneuver through the main channel span of the Sunshine Bridge and the starboard bow of the DANK SILVER allided with the Sunshine Bridge main channel span and fender system. The vessel made contact with the fender system in way of its #2 starboard ballast tank and the vessel sustained multiple insets along the #2 starboard ballast tank. Significant damage was caused to the fender system and the main channel span concrete pier on the SUNSHINE BRIDGE. The DANK SILVER sustained approximately $1 million in damage and the Sunshine Bridge sustained approximately $3.5 million in damage. 

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event was the allision with the Sunshine Bridge and the subsequent events were the 1) material failure of the DANK SILVER's starboard hull and, 2) the material failure of the Sunshine Bridge's fender system and bridge pier.

The pulling vessel was located approximately 100 feet away and toward the center of the barge. The pushing vessel was located directly in contact with the center aft of the barge. The barge was heading north bound through the Houma Navigational Canal Bridge when the starboard bow allided with the fender wall. The master reported that at the time of the allision, the waterway had a strong head current that influenced the movement of the barge, impeding the towing vessel to maintain the steady control of the barge’s movement, allowing the barge to drift into the bridge’s fender wall. The bridge’s opening was approximately 128 feet and the barge was 100 feet wide. The bridge operator reported the allision to the New Orleans Sector Command Center.   

The allision resulted in no damage to the towing vessel. The barge and bridge sustained minor scrapes. The bridge was fully functional for both, vessel and vehicle traffic. There was no water ingress, injuries or pollution reported.

As a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the vessel (barge) maneuver caused by the increased head current. This was followed by the allision of the barge with the bridge’s fender wall. The casual factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) The significant difference in horsepower between the pulling and the pushing towing vessels, (2) insufficient horsepower pushing the barge to compensate the strong current in the area of the bridge, (3) an increased head current in the area of the bridge, compared to the area of the canal before the bridge and, (4) the significant small difference between the width of the bridge area and the width of the barge.",LA,Terrebonne Parish,['GIWW-WEST'],['Houma Navigational Canal Bridge'],"['M/V JACK NEWMAN', 'JODY ANN', 'MARMAC 301']","29.56832,-90.72076"

The ITV reported no damage, pollution or injuries.

Casualty investigators from USCG MSU Pittsburgh attended the vessel to conduct an investigation into this reportable marine casualty.  It was discovered that the LADY TEREA was shifting two barges at a dock and was utilizing assistance from the ITV LONNIE M BELL for the shifting of the barges.  The plan was for the LONNIE M BELL to rig a headline on the head of the barge (upstream) and assist in keeping the head of the barge under control.  The LADY TEREA was made off on the hip of the barges.  The shift began as planned, but the deckhand on the LONNIE M BELL allowed the headline to slip off and the head of the barge unexpectedly began a swing to starboard as a result of river current.  The LADY TEREA was unable to maintain control of the barges, the LONNIE M BELL was unable to reattach the headline in a timely manner, and as a result, the head of the barge (CBC 1274) made incidental contact with the Vanport Bridge pier located adjacent the left descending bank.  In addition to the bridge, prior to alliding with the bridge the the barge made contact with the dock wall causing minor damage to the dock.  After contact with the dock and bridge the barges were safely moved back to the dock without further incident.

The crane barge (JRB 4540) was moored against the CARGILL facility pilings approximately 1000 feet downstream of the bridge on the LDB.  As a result of the barge (AEP 7015) allision with the crane barge (JRB 4540) the ITV CAPT RICHARD SIDES stern was set over and allided with the RDB Meredosia Highway Bridge. The allisions resulted in a very small dent in the crane barge. The ITV CAPT RICHARD SIDES had minor damage (dent) to STBD quarter.

Upon approaching the Black Bayou Bridge, a swing bridge, the operator placed the vessel in standby while waiting for other vessels to pass through. When it was time for the INDEPENDENCE to pass through the bridge, the operator called out on radio channel 13 to get confirmation from the bridge operator that the bridge was open. After calling out multiple times, the operator of the INDEPENDENCE got no response from the bridge operator. 

Shortly after reaching out to the bridge operator, the operator of the INDEPENDENCE witnessed another towing vessel pass through the open bridge. The operator of the INDEPENDENCE then called out on radio channel 14 to get in touch with the operator of the Calcasieu Locks, which were just on the other side of the Bayou Black Bridge. The operator of the Calcasieu Locks instructed the INDEPENDENCE to push up against the ""long wall"" while waiting for the locks to open. After receiving these instructions, the operator of the INDEPENDENCE made the assumption that the Bayou Black Bridge was open, even though there was no communication between the operator of the INDEPENDENCE and the operator of the Bayou Black Bridge. Due to it being dark, the operator and crew could not visually confirm the bridge was open. The operator also referenced the vessel's Rose Point navigation system, which displayed a chart of the area and the Bayou Black Bridge. The chart shown on the Rose Point system appeared to show the bridge in an open position, which the operator incorrectly assumed was part of the functionality of the navigation system. 

The operator of the INDEPENDENCE then began to make way towards the Bayou Black Bridge with two deckhands posted on the bow of its forward-most barges. As the INDEPENDENCE got closer to the bridge, the lookouts realized the bridge was closed and relayed this information via radio to the operator. The operator then began to back the vessel down. However, due to the weight of all six loaded barges, the forward momentum of the tug and barges continued and the INDEPENDENCE struck the Bayou Black Bridge at a speed of approximately .5 knots with the port bow of barge GBW-97.

The pontoon boat reportedly struck the bridge after experiencing engine issues resulting in the capsizing of the vessel and all 15 individuals entering the water.  All individuals involved were recovered safely and declined on-scene medical services, however, it was later reported that a young girl was taken to the hospital for evaluation after swallowing water and having minor injuries to her head.  The vessel was rented from Under the Bridge Watersports in Ocean City, MD.  The vessel was towed by Towboat US and taken out of the water by the vessel's owner. 

Further investigation revealed the following:

Claims of engine failure were centered around the renter's claims that the engine was lifted after a soft grounding and then could not be trimmed back down.  Pictures of the vessel immediately following the incident show that the vessel's outdrive was in the down position, and was in fact the area to which the tow line was affixed.  In addition, the investigator visited the engine mechanic responsible for the maintenance of the craft and who took possession of the engine after the casualty.  The engine was hooked to a battery and the mechanic was able to show the investigators that there were no issues with the trim functions of the vessel's engine.  Lastly, a bystander on shore was interviewed by investigators and relayed that the vessel was clutched in reverse and making astern propulsion just prior to striking the bridge.  The investigator was unable to corroborate the renter's claims of engine failure as it relates to the engine not being able to be trimmed down after being raised.

Interviews with the operator revealed that the vessel was loaded in excess of the vessel's information plate.  While the vessel was rated for 16 people, it also indicated a maximum passenger weight of 2270lbs.  The weight of the passengers onboard was found to be 3021 lbs.  The capacity plate did indicate an engine of 140hp, and there was a 90hp engine installed.  A call to Godfrey Pontoon Boats was placed and they relayed that the engine rating on a capacity plate is for the maximum allowable hp.  A general rule was used of 40lbs of passenger rate for each hp of the engine and the boat was found to be sufficiently powered given the weight of the 15 passengers despite it being overloaded with regards to the capacity plate.

There was a matter discovered during the course of the investigation that relates to the Passenger Vessel Safety Act and corresponding federal inspection regulations.  The vessel had 15 passengers onboard a vessel that was bareboat chartered without the crew provided.  Due to the amount of individuals onboard, federal regulations would have classified this vessel as an inspected vessel and therefore subject to the regulations found within 46 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Subchapter T.

The barges were carried downstream by strong currents intensified by the recent torrential rains affecting the region and the overflow from the Lake Houston spillway. The barges struck the Interstate-10 Bridge (I-10), causing near-catastrophic damage to the bridge.

The San Jacinto River Fleet, located just northwest of the Interstate-10 Bridge, has been in operation since 2011 and consists of seven areas, or tiers, where vessels are moored. Several of these tiers consist of steel pilings, while others consist of spud barges. A spud barge is a type of barge that is moored by steel shafts or through-deck pilings, which are essentially pipes driven right into the soil or sand at the bottom of the water to provide stability for the barge. Due to the low clearance of the I-10 Bridge, access to the Jacinto fleeting area is mainly limited to inland tank barges and towing vessels with retractable wheelhouses.
The Houston-Galveston area was seriously affected by tropical storm Imelda, which had reached the area on September 17, 2019. Imelda was initially predicted to produce five to ten inches of rain in the area; however, by the time Imelda cleared the area, the storm had produced over forty inches of rain in some areas. This unexpected rain caused significant flooding in the area and pushed Lake Houston into the ""major"" flood stage.
Lake Houston, managed by the Coastal Water Authority, is located northeast of Houston and supplies drinking water for the city. The east fork of the San Jacinto River located in northeast Harris County forms Lake Houston.  The Lake Houston dam has a 3,160-foot long spillway and uses four gates to manage the water level. The two radial gates are designed to release high volumes of water, and the two flashboard gates are used for minor adjustments to the lake level. The lake discharges into and directly affects the lower San Jacinto River. The San Jacinto River runs from Lake Houston in Harris County to Galveston Bay.
The rainfall from tropical storm Imelda caused Lake Houston water level to increase rapidly and pushed Lake Houston into a ""major"" flood stage. At that flood stage, an approximate four to six-foot-high water wall was flowing over the spillway and into the San Jacinto River. The natural release of water over the spillway into the San Jacinto River resulted in high water levels and strong currents, which affected areas and vessels downriver.
Cheryl K LLC is owned and operated by the same parties that manage the San Jacinto River Fleet and operates five towing vessels with retractable wheelhouses to conduct its day-to-day fleeting operations. A wheelhouse capable of being lowered is necessary to transit under the I-10 Bridge.  The San Jacinto River Fleet is solely responsible for all vessel movements into and out of the fleeting area. The operating permit status of the San Jacinto River Fleet could not be determined during this investigation and remains under review.
The San Jacinto River fleet had eleven barges moored at tier three on September 19, 2019. Two barges were empty, and the remaining nine barges were loaded with different products. The strong river currents on the San Jacinto River caused the synthetic lines securing the barges to tier three to part, and the eleven barges broke free and began drifting.  The barges drifted in a southeasterly direction, eventually grounding just south-southeast of the fleeting area.
Cheryl K had four fleet towing vessels in operation that evening. Three towing vessels worked to remove the two empty barges and tied the barges back up in the fleeting area. Of the remaining nine loaded red-flag barges, one barge grounded, and eight barges floated free and continued to drift towards the I-10 Bridge. Despite Cheryl K's towing vessels' efforts, the eight barges eventually struck the Interstate-10 Bridge fendering system and bridge support pilings. Two barges became lodged under the bridge's west span, and the remaining six barges passed under the bridge.  The allision resulted in damage to numerous barges and caused severe structural damage to the bridge. The Texas Department of Transportation closed the interstate bridge to vehicle traffic in both directions. 
Once the six barges cleared the bridge, towing vessels secured them by grabbing and pushing them onto the mud bank. Efforts to dislodge the two barges from under the bridge were initially impeded by high water levels and the strong current. However, once the currents abated and the water level receded, the barges were removed without further incident.
 
The Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was either an inadequate number of lines or an insufficient breaking strength of the lines employed. The strong river currents, caused by the unanticipated and unpredicted weather event, placed a heavy strain on the soft securing lines which caused them to part.",TX,Harris County,"['SAN JACINTO RIVER', 'SAN JACINTO RIVER', 'San Jacinto River']","['INTERSTATE 10 BRIDGE', 'San Jacinto River Fleet, llc']","['IB 921', 'IB 1927', 'IB9123', 'JB BLOOMER', 'SARA K', 'CARESSA K', 'CHERYL K', 'IB 1021', 'CBC 193', 'KIRBY 28139', 'CBC 345', 'IB1954', 'IB1960', 'IB1985', 'CBC 1403', 'CBC 1406', 'CBC 1407']","29.79205,-95.06486"

6819564,27.75019,-82.62326,"On September 9, 2019, Coast Guard Sector Saint Petersburg received a notification from the project manager for a work site used by the uninspected towing vessel KEELBACK (1298632) pushing the deck barge CMS 751 (CG1056096) loaded with concrete pilings concerning the barge alliding with an aid to navigation and a subsequent allision with the Dick Misener bridge in Tampa Bay, Florida.  KEELBACK is a 25 foot uninspected towing vessel and CMS 751 is a 192 foot/677 gross ton deck barge.  The captain was transiting from Standard Concrete Products in Tampa, Florida to a bridge construction project near Tierra Verde, Florida in KEELBACK pushing ahead CMS 751; KEELBACK had just completed construction on August 28, 2019.  It was the first time that the captain had operated the vessel except for a one-hour familiarization sea trial.  The captain noted that the hydraulic steering had a tendency to stick while conducting the sea trial.  The captain performed this specific transit before with one row of concrete pilings but this time there were two rows of pilings that restricted his visibility to a 12-foot opening centerline of the vessel.  A lookout was positioned on the bow of the barge with a radio to communicate with the vessel captain.  As the tow approached Boca Ciega Bay Daybeacon ""G7"" in the intercostal waterway of Tampa Bay, the lookout informed the captain that he needed to bring the vessel to starboard to avoid the day beacon.  The captain could not correct the course in sufficient time before contacting the day beacon citing a temporary steering failure.  As a result, the day beacon was destroyed.

The captain continued to push the tow two miles west to the Dick Misener Bridge entrance.  When the tow reached the last marker ""G13"" before the bridge entrance, the captain felt the tow was misaligned and he needed to back down and re-center the tow prior to entry.  The captain backed the vessel down and attempted correct the vessel course, however, there was outward tidal flow that reduced steerage and pushed the tow to the port into a fendering system and a concrete footing of the bridge.  The port engine for KEELBACK overheated and shut down several times as the captain attempted to reposition the tow.  The captain kept the tow steady until a company skiff arrived on scene to push the tow back into the entrance where it successfully passed under the bridge.  During the vessel maneuver, the captain was able to restart the port engine.  An Investigating Officer from Sector Saint Petersburg directed chemical testing for crewmembers directly involved.  The vessel master and crewmember received non-DOT alcohol and chemical testing; results were.

As a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event for the allisions with both the aid to navigation and bridge were a reduction in steering.  Causal factors included 1) poor judgment by the company to require a transit with restricted visibility, 2) a failure by the vessel captain to address the restricted visibility, 3) a faulty rudder control joystick, 4) restricted visibility for the vessel captain by the concrete pilings on CMS 751 and 5) and ebb tide that pushed the tow to the port in both allisions.  Subsequent events included 1) An allision with Boca Ciega Bay Daybeacon ""G7"", 2) an allision with the Dick Misener Bridge and 3) several losses of propulsion by the port engine of KEELBACK.

As the vessel was approaching the Crescent RR Drawbridge transit area, a strong current of 2-3 mph began to push the tow towards the outside of the channel on the right descending bank side. An assist vessel was present to help the ITV MIKE BIRD with its transit through the area and it attempted to push the tow back into the channel but was unsuccessful.  The pilot of the ITV MIKE BIRD determined that if he maintained the track the vessel was on, he would not be able to navigate through the Crescent RR Drawbridge transit area without an allision occurring, so he began to back the vessel towards the right descending bank.  Although the vessel was backing it continued to move S/B which led to the tow’s stbd lead barge, the KIRBY 27723 (O.N. 1166472), alliding with the shear fence that runs parallel underneath the bridge.  As a result of the allision the barge wires connecting the ITV MIKE BIRD to the tow were disconnected and the tow vessel lost positive control of the tow.  The pilot of the ITV MIKE BIRD then repositioned the vessel and the crew connected a tow line to the barges along the hip, which enabled the ITV MIKE BIRD to pull the barges up river away from the bridge along the right descending bank.

The ECB 6007 was being pushed ahead by the towing vessel CANDICE L (Official Number 616343). The Master was at the helm. He had direction and control of the vessel. The deckhand was standing on the barge serving as a lookout. As the Master began to transit through the bridge, he pushed the barge closer to the north west side in preparation for the upcoming turn that was on the other side of the bridge. The observed weather conditions were approximately 3 knot winds from the southeast, clear skies, and unrestricted visibility. The tide was ebbing. As the Master began to set up for the turn, the current set the barge, and the Master was unable to maneuver away from the bridge. The barge's starboard quarter made contact with the east bridge fender. The lookout walked towards the stern of the barge and did not observe any damage to the barge or towing vessel. The City of Chesapeake Bridge manager conducted a post-accident survey of the bridge. It was discovered that one of the rub plates was missing from the rubber fender. Another rub plate had the connectors sheared off. The City of Chesapeake provided a damage estimate of $9,037.

The vessel self-reported the incident to the Sector Hampton Roads Command Center. Investigating Officers attended the vessel, which was moored alongside the anchored barge approximately 0.5 miles offshore. It was discovered that the Master's Merchant Mariner Credential was expired. It was also discovered that the Master did not possess a valid medical certificate. His medical certificate expired in 2016. Lastly, the barge did not have a load line and was being used to transport equipment past the boundary line.

Through its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event was the improper vessel maneuver by the Master. The subsequent event was the bridge allision. The causal factors that contributed to this incident include: (1) Attention failure.

BROOKS SPERRY pushing ahead two loaded red flagged barges had the port bow of the tow's lead barge allide the Bayou Dularge Bridge Fender System.  This caused damage to the tow's lead barge, FMT-3212.  Barge FMT-3212 suffered heavy dents to the port bow void all above the waterline and was not taking on water.  Neither the bridge nor the other vessels in the tow reported damage.  The other barge in the tow was the FMT-3063.  Each barge had a length of 297 feet long by 54 feet wide making the tow's total length near 600 feet long.  The Bayou Dularge Bridge span opening is only 125 feet wide.  

The allision occurred at night with near zero visibility.  The ITV G. BROOKS SPERRY had 2,600 hp with two 1,300 Cummins Engines and this was the vessel's maiden voyage.  The allision occurred as the ITV G. BROOKS SPERRY was underway east bound along the Gulf Intracoastal Water Way (GIWW) approaching MM 59.5 west of the Harvey Lock.  The tow got underway from Sun Oil in Port Author, Texas and was heading to Exxon Chalmette on the Lower Mississippi River.  Each barge was loaded with 22,000 barrels of crude oil.  The master has been a captain for 10 years and has made the transit through this area many times before, but with smaller tow configurations.  This time the master underestimated the current with the larger than normal tow size.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determine the initiating event was barge FMT-3212 alliding the port side bridge fender system.  This caused heavy damage to barge FMT-3212's port bow all above the water line.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:  1) The Bayou Chene Route was closed for larger tow configurations.  A large tow configuration of this size (being 600' long by 54' wide) normally would have bypassed the narrow and congested GIWW through Houma and taken Bayou Chene to the Gulf of Mexico and reentered the GIWW east of Houma.  But, due to the recent Hurricane Barry and local area flood risks, the Bayou Chene Route was shut-off to marine traffic.  2) The Bayou Dularge Bridge Span opening is only 125' wide and the tow width was 54' wide and 600' long.  This left little room for error to prevent the barges from alliding the bridge fender system.  Normally, the barges that pass through this span are only 35' wide by 400' long.  3) Night time operations with near zero visibility make it difficult for any mariner to properly assess collision/allision risks.  4) The master stated he underestimated the current that he hoped would help set his barges up to make the bridge span opening.

At approximately 12:45 p.m., the COLONIAL BELLE navigated under the Marsh Road Bridge at slow bell on a westerly course with a reportedly 6"" clearance between the vessel’s safety rail and bridge.  At approximately 12:50 p.m., Lock 32 on the Erie Canal, which is located approximately 4.5 miles west of the Marsh Road Bridge, locked through a vessel transiting east and dumped approximately 2.77 million gallons of water into the Erie Canal pool below the Marsh Road Bridge.  At approximately 1:00 p.m., the COLONIAL BELLE navigated at slow bell on an easterly course under the center of the Marsh Road Bridge when the aft safety handrail allided with a steel I-beam on the bottom side of the Marsh Road Bridge.  

The Marsh Road Bridge did not sustain damage but the COLONIAL BELLE’s starboard aft safety handrail was bent approximately 1” down and several handrail welds broke.  The COLONIAL BELLE transited to their mooring without further incident and safely moored. 

The Erie Canal water level for the pool in which the COLONIAL BELLE operated was 462.8 on the day of the incident.  At a maximum pool elevation of 463.00, the vertical clearance under the Marsh Road Bridge is 15.54' or 15' 6"".

Prior to the incident, Lock 32 locked through an eastbound vessel which increased the pool level at the incident site by an unknown amount. 

As a result of this investigation, the U.S. Coast Guard determined that the initiating event for this casualty was an allision with the Marsh Road Bridge that subsequently led to damage to the vessel’s aft safety handrail.

6857420,35.76771,-75.53025,"In March 2019, PCL Civil Constructors, Inc. (PCL) and subcontractor Cherry Creek Recycling initiated a project to dismantle and demolish the existing 2-3 mile long Herbert C. Bonner Bridge (Bonner Bridge) spanning across Oregon Inlet. PCL utilized the deck barge U 210 (Official Number (O.N.) 1052577), the deck barge WEEKS 2220 (O.N. 1233586), the crane barge BR24072 (O.N. 553579), the towing vessel MISS BONNIE (O.N. 502796) and subcontracted various other towing vessels to haul the barges offshore and dispose of bridge pieces in designated artificial reef zones. 

On Thursday, November 14, 2019, weather forecasts predicted a storm with wind gusts of approximately 50 knots in the Outer Banks over that weekend. In accordance with the Severe Weather & Hurricane Plan, the PCL Project Manager secured the U 210, WEEKS 2220, and BR24072 with an additional set of mooring lines to ten mooring pilings located approximately 400 feet east of the remaining superstructure of the Bonner Bridge. On November 16, 2019, a coastal storm started to get closer to the Outer Banks coastline and by Saturday evening into early Sunday the storm brought winds of up to 44 knots to the coast. On November 17, 2019, at approximately 0730 Eastern Standard Time (EST), sustained winds were 25-30 knots above what PCL Project Manager believed they would be, prompting him to direct a PCL employee to drive through the worksite to confirm all barges were moored to the pilings. The PCL employee confirmed they were. 

At approximately 1000 EST, the North Carolina Department of Transportation called the PCL Project Manager to report that the U 210 and WEEKS 2220 had broken free and were adrift in Oregon Inlet. The PCL Project Manager then directed his employees to report to the worksite immediately to secure the adrift barges. At approximately 1030 EST, seven PCL employees arrived at the worksite and found both barges pinned up against the mooring pilings approximately two feet from the Bonner Bridge superstructure. The PCL crew decided to use the towing vessel MISS BONNIE, which was moored at the PCL dock on Pea Island, to recover the two barges. At approximately 1050 EST, MISS BONNIE got underway with seven persons onboard. As MISS BONNIE passed safely under the Marc Basnight Bridge (the new bridge that replaced the Bonner Bridge) and was getting closer to the pilings where the barges were pinned, the vessel ran aground on a shoal. The captain attempted to maneuver the vessel to free it from grounding, but was unsuccessful. After several attempts, the strong wind and current began to push MISS BONNIE toward the superstructure of the Bonner Bridge. As the vessel was pushed toward the bridge, the vessel slowly began to list to port and take on water over the port side gunwale. At approximately 1102 EST, the captain ordered the crew to abandon the vessel. All seven MISS BONNIE crewmembers climbed onto the superstructure of the bridge without entering the water and without suffering any injuries. At approximately 1130 EST, the MISS BONNIE capsized. The port side of the vessel rested on the ocean floor, while a portion of the starboard side was visible above water. While on the bridge, a PCL employee used a forklift to position a gangway from the bridge to each of the barges to secure the barges to the pilings. 

The PCL Project Manager directed all crewmembers to undergo drug and alcohol testing in accordance with company procedures; however, these procedures did not meet Department of Transportation regulations. The Project Manager was not familiar with 46 CFR Part 4 requirements. This was their first marine casualty and he believed the company procedures would suffice. 

The initiating event for this casualty was the parting of the mooring lines on the U 210 and the WEEKS 2220, which set both barges adrift. The barges then allided with the mooring pilings next to the Bonner Bridge. MISS BONNIE got underway in heavy weather to secure the barges, but grounded and then capsized while en route. The causal factors contributing to this casualty include: (1) PCL Project Manager failed to provide chafing protection on mooring lines, (2) the effect of the weather conditions on the barges due to a minimally protected mooring area, (3) PCL Project Manager failed to moor the barges at the south trestle dock, (4) unknown shoaling caused by rapid changes in water depth of Oregon Inlet, (5) inoperable echo depth sounder, (6) the 33 knot sustained winds and six knot flooding current caused MISS BONNIE to list to port, (7) the loss of stability due to seawater going over the gunwale, and (8) the loss of stability due to uncontrolled flooding.",NC,Dare County,['Pamlico Sound'],"['Herbert C.

While transiting upriver toward Ama Anchorage (MM 117), the NOBRA Pilot onboard documented that the vessel’s air draft was listed as 42.3m on the pilot card prior to proceeding under the Huey P Long Bridge.  The NOAA recorded air draft was 43.3m, a 1 meter clearance. As the PRODIGY went under the bridge, the INMARSAT antenna made contact with the centerline bridge span, approximately 3 feet to the right of the channel lights. Damage onboard the vessel was a broken INMARSAT antenna and mount estimated at $10,000 to replace. Bridge owner (LADOTD) verified that there was no damage to the bridge due to this incident.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event for the casualty was the PRODIGY INMARSAT antenna striking the Huey P Long Bridge.

Additionally, the bridge's fendering system received damage estimated at approximately $55,000.

During the investigation, it was identified that the relief master began his approach on an eastbound transit, contacted the Roosevelt Bridge operator for a bridge opening, cleared the Roosevelt Bridge and began adjusting his course for the second bridge, the Stuart FEC Railway Bridge, when a shift in current caused the vessel's port bow to react unexpectedly, giving the master no time to adjust. Following the temporary loss in maneuverability, the vessel's protruding trunnion guard allided with the bridge's north fendering system, causing the vessel to rebound towards the south fendering system, where the vessel rolled to starboard. Upon rolling to starboard, the vessel's life raft station protruded past the bridge's lifted bascule as the vessel continued forward momentum, at which point the life raft station allided with the bascule, leading to damage of the starboard side life raft station, hand rail, and running light.

As the vessel’s Licensed Mate was setting up to transit through the railroad bridge, the current started to set the tow towards the east. The Mate attempted to steer against the set, but felt that the tow wasn't going to respond fast enough, so he started backing down and steering his flanking rudder to avoid or mitigate impact with the railroad bridge. At approximately 1604, the lead barge (SL 54) in the port string allided with east pier of the channel span. 

The impact of the allision parted multiple tow wires, causing four of the six barges to break away from the tow. The bow void space of the SL 54 suffered extensive structural damage, subsequently causing the bow void space to flood to the river level. The Melville Railroad Bridge remained operational, with only superficial scratches noted in the concrete pillar of the east bridge span.

As a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of barge SL 54 with the Melville Railroad Bridge, which caused extensive damage to the bow void of the barge.  The causal factors of this casualty include: (1) The vessel’s Licensed Mate lacked experience navigating a tow downriver though the spans of the railroad bridge and (2) Unanticipated river current caused an uncontrollable slide toward the east span of the railroad bridge.",LA,St. Landry Parish,['ATCHAFALAY'],['Melville Railroad Bridge'],"['SOUTHERN BELLE', 'SL 54']","30.69068,-91.73447"

Approximately 1/4-mile from the bridge, the master radioed the Bridge Tender to request an opening for northbound passage and continued transiting toward the bridge. At approximately 0610, the Bride Tender responded the master's request and opened the bridge for north bound passage. 

After the drawbridge span was opened, the master navigated the vessels in to the drawbridge channel entrance at approximately 1-knot. While entering the channel within the boundary of the drawbridge fender system, the towing vessel and barge were set to port by a flooding tidal current of approximately 3-knots. The master corrected with starboard rudder to prevent the STEVENS 1401 from alliding with the southwest dolphin and fender.  The STEVENS 1401 swung to starboard and the ISLAND TRADER's stern set to port and the towing vessel's port stern quarter allided with the southwest dolphin and fender system. 

The vessel continued beneath the drawbridge span on a course toward the northeast fender. The master corrected with port rudder to prevent the STEVENS 1401 from alliding with the northeast fender. While in a port turn, the STEVENS 1401 starboard bow allided with the northeast fender.

6869011,29.56792,-90.7205,"On August 8, 2019 at about 01:15 CST, the UTV CAPTAIN SAM pulling astern empty deck barge MARMAC 301 had the starboard bow of barge MARMAC 301 lightly allide the Bayou Dularge Bridge Fender System.  This caused scuff marks to the barge and no damage to the bridge fender system.  Barge MARMAC 301 had a length of 300 feet long by 100 feet wide.  The Bayou Dularge Bridge span opening was only 125 feet wide.  

The allision occurred as the tow was underway east bound along the Gulf Intracoastal Water Way (GIWW) approaching MM 59.5 west of the Harvey Lock.  The tow got underway at 21:30 the previous evening from Mars Dock in Bayou Black, Louisiana and was heading to the Houma Navigational Canal; then, to the Cat Island Sea Buoy.  The UTV CAPTAIN SAM had the UTV CAPT MARK pushing MARMAC 301 astern; but, the master of the UTV CAPTAIN SAM had command of the entire tow.  A tow this size would have normally taken the Bayou Chene Route to the Gulf of Mexico and bypassed the narrow and congested GIWW in and around Houma, Louisiana.  But, due to high river levels in the Mississippi River and flooding threats to areas of South Louisiana, the Bayou Chene Route was closed to all marine traffic.  At about 01:00 CST, the tow made the bend that approached the Bayou Dularge Bridge; but, the tow sung out too wide.  There was not enough space or time for the tow to get realigned to the bridge span opening and that caused the starboard bow of the MARMAC 301 to lightly allide with the bridge fender system.  No damage was done the MARMAC 301 (other than scuffed paint) and no damage was reported by the bridge operator.  

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determine the initiating event was barge MARMAC 301 alliding the Bayou Dularge Bridge Fender System.  This caused no damage to barge MARMAC 301 (other than scuffed paint) and no damage to the bridge fender system.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:  1) The Bayou Chene Route was closed for larger tow configurations.  A large tow configuration of this size (being 300' long by 100' wide) normally would have bypassed the narrow and congested GIWW through Houma and taken Bayou Chene to the Gulf of Mexico and reentered the GIWW east of Houma.  But, due to the recent Hurricane Barry and local area flood risks, the Bayou Chene Route was shut-off to marine traffic.  2) The Bayou Dularge Bridge Span opening was only 125' wide and the tow width was 100' wide and 300' long.  This left little room for error to prevent the barge from alliding the bridge fender system.  3) Night time operations with near zero visibility made it difficult for the master properly assess collision/allision risks.",LA,Terrebonne Parish,['GIWW-WEST'],['Bayou Dularge Bridge'],"['CAPTAIN MARK', 'MARMAC 301', 'CAPTAIN SAM']","29.56792,-90.7205"

The operator navigated the vessel with the main sail and jib unfurled, but under primary propulsion of the main engine.  The vessel  transited upon the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (AICW) on a southerly course toward the Cape Fear River via Snow's Cut during high tide.  At approx. 1030, the vessel approached the AICW US Highway 421 Carolina Beach Rd. Bridge, also known as, Snow's Cut Bridge.  The vessel was transiting at approx. 2-knots when it passed under the bridge span at the center of the navigable channel.  While transiting below the bridge, the vessel's weather antenna mounted atop the main mast struck the center channel navigation light suspended beneath the bridge span. 

The navigation light broke from its mounted position and plunged into the water adjacent to the vessel's stern.  The operator realized what occurred, terminated the voyage, and turned the vessel around on a northerly course.  The vessel transited under the bridge a second time without further incident and returned to Carolina Beach Boat Basin where it was safely moored.  The operator and passenger notified the owner of the incident and departed the vessel. A Good Samaritan witness and the North Carolina Department of Transportation notified the Coast Guard of the vessel's mast alliding and damaging the bridge channel aid to navigation light.

The Mate was operating MERRIMAC and attempted to line up the towing vessel and barge to transit through the Centerville Turnpike bridge fender system. The wind at the time was out of the southwest and the Mate slowed the towing vessel to approximately two knots in order to transit safely through the fender system. At approximately 0310 LMT, the starboard bow of SJ 700 made contact with the northeast fender system for the Centerville Turnpike bridge. The fender system was already damaged from a previous vessel allision, and the bow of SJ 700 did not cause any additional damage to the Centerville Turnpike bridge fender system.

At approximately 1400 local time, while transiting under the Mid Bay Bridge, winds out of the south set the barges towards the north, causing the starboard aft barge (MTC 0106) to allide with the northern section of fendering system.  MTC 0106 laid alongside the fendering system for approximately ten seconds, and the Pilot was able to continue westbound without further incident.  No damage was observed to the barge and minimal damage was observed to the fendering system, both by the BILL JR crew and USCG Station Destin, who responded to the incident location.  Florida Department of Transportation personnel responded to the incident location and confirmed that no damage occurred to the bridge itself and that damage to the fendering system was estimated to cost less than $5,000.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined the initiating event for this casualty was the effect of the on scene wind gusts on the tow while transiting through the Mid Bay Bridge, which caused an allision with the fendering system of the bridge.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the winds pushed/set the empty open hopper barges to the north while transiting under the Mid Bay Bridge, and (2) the inability of the master/pilot to anticipate the effects of wind on the tow.

The uninspected towing vessel LITTLE MARY (Official Number 1235276) was also assisting with the towing evolution. The observed weather conditions were clear skies, with 10-12 knot winds from the west, and an ebbing tide. A Virginia State Pilot was hired for the towing evolution. The Pilot discussed the bridge transit with the Masters of the towing vessels. He then proceeded to stand on the starboard bow of the JMC 256. He directed the SEA COAST to lay flat along the port bow without a line. The LITTLE MARY was directed to lay along the port quarter of the JMC 256. The Master of the SEA COAST positioned a lookout on the port side outside of the wheelhouse. As the lookout called out distances, the Master of the SEA COAST relayed the distances to the Pilot standing on the barge. As they began to exit along the South side of the bridge span, the stern of the SEA COAST allided with the southeast fender of the Gilmerton Bridge. A four foot rubber panel fell off the fender. A representative from the City of Chesapeake visited the bridge and assessed the total cost for the damages at $3,000.00.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event was the bridge allision. The causal factors that contributed to this event include: (1) transiting through a narrow bridge span; (2) The SEA COAST did not have a tow line on the JMC 256, had there been a tow line the Master of the SEA COAST may have felt more confident pushing against the barge to avoid the allision and in his ability to prevent the JMC 256 from possibly alliding with the west side fender.

As the tow entered a bend near mile marker 246, the Captain began steering to port but noticed the rudder indicator showed the rudder hard to starboard.  The Captain switched to the backup steering pump with no change.  Steering was switched to non-follow-up and the rudder responded properly.  However, due to high water conditions, oncoming current, and the steering loss the tow continued to drift and eventually the head of the tow struck the bank.  After the head of the tow struck the bank, nine of the 15 barges broke free and drifted down the river.  

Following the casualty, the Captain examined the steering system and found that the follow-up steering shaft manual limit pin was missing.  This pin was replaced on-scene and all steering capabilities returned to the vessel.  The CAPT. W.D. NUNLEY then proceeded to gather the barges that had broken free without further incident.  

After the barges broke free, the CAPT. W.D. NUNLEY began the process of retrieving its barges.  It was reported some of the barges drifted approximately 10 miles downriver until secured.   Several Good Samaritan vessels assisted in securing the barges.  It was reported that one barge struck the Pomeroy-Mason Bridge near mile marker 251.3.

At 0930 the employees prepared to conduct a construction operation located on the north side of the canal. To reach the new construction site, the UNNAMED DECK BARGE and excavator would need to pass under the Eden Isle Canal Bridge. Employees 2 and 3 remained onboard LA 2627 GH, moving the deck barge toward the Eden Isle Canal Bridge. Employee 1 remained onboard the deck barge in the operator's cabin of the excavator. As the barge and excavator approached the bridge, Employee 1 was in the excavator’s cab driving it closer to the bow of the barge in order to shift the weight of the excavator forward decreasing the freeboard of the barge to allow the excavator to pass freely under the bridge. As the barge attempted to pass under the bridge through bents #2 and #3, the top of the excavator made contact with the bottom of the bridge. After unsuccessfully transiting under the bridge, Employee 1 once again shifted the excavator forward to reduce the forward freeboard of the barge. The forward weight shift of the excavator caused the uncontrollable submersion of the bow, thereby capsizing the barge. Employee 1 entered the water and was pinned between the capsized barge and bridge bent #2.

At approximately 2130, the Master of the TERMITE, at the direction of the Master of the AMERICAN intentionally pressed the fwd barge (MB 153) up against the bridge fendering system in an attempt to correct the course of the AMERICAN and keep the stern portion of the tow/barge from striking the bridge and the wood fendering at the entrance to the bridge.  The Master stated that his course had to be corrected due to the wind and current conditions as he began to pass through the bridge with the towing configuration that he was in.  During this maneuvering, the AMERICAN's tow line made contact with a power line poll guide wire and caused it to break.  The Master called his company manager who reported it to the Coast Guard.  Mobro Marine conducted Drug and Alcohol Testing on those directly involved as per their company policy. 

Bridge Inspector reported the following day that there was no obvious damage to the bridge fendering but there were several suspect areas of damage to which he later confirmed were pre-existing.

The foreman on board the DEVIN on August 3rd and the manager of the operation. The manager checked the weather on August 3rd and instructed the foreman to secure iron and loose objects onboard the DEVIN and the construction barge. The foreman reseated the 70 ft. spuds and were approximately 40 ft. into the Schuylkill. The foreman then added additional lines from the DEVIN to the material barge to secure it.

During the storm the DEVIN was moored on the west side of the Schuylkill with the material barge on the starboard side. The spuds had a material failure and bent, causing the DEVIN and material barge to drift towards the CSX bridge. Eventually the DEVIN would allided with the CSX Bridge. The DEVIN struck the fendering system of the CSX Bridge with the bow rake. A majority of the damage was sustained with the spuds, with the port aft spud creating a hole in the stern box.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the the material failure of the spuds. This was followed by the eventual allision. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) Tropical Storm Isaias caused a surge of debris in the Schuylkill river.

Had the company created SOP/Policies in writing for managers/employees to follow, they could have been more prepared for the storm, (3) Prior to Tropical Storm Isaias the managers from AP construction made the decision to utilize all four spuds on the DEVIN. In addition, they tied off the material barge to the stbrd side with additional line. This was a causal factor because the additional weight of the construction barge plus the additional weight of water and debris created additional weight that exceeded the spuds strength. (4) For previous storms, using all four spuds were proven to be efficient during heavy weather. However, during Tropical Storm Isaias this plan was proved to be faulty.

The Coast Guard Investigating Officer spoke with the bridge tender via phone and no clear explanation was given as to why the lift bridge was lowered before the tow cleared the bridge, except that it was a mistake or misunderstanding.  The bridge is located along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway at mile marker 35.6 west of the Harvey Locks.  It is a Louisiana State Bridge.

The vessel's mast pole was damaged after being impacted from above by the lowering bridge.  The UTV LAROSE had an air space or height of about 47 feet from the waterline to the very top of the highest antenna.  The West Larose Lift Bridge height is 37 feet above the water's surface in the down position and in the raised position is 70 feet above the water's surface.  The bridge was opened all the way when the tow was ¼ mile from the bridge span.  After both leading barges cleared the span, but just before the UTV LAROSE was immediately under the span, the bridge tinder wrongfully lowered the bridge onto the UTV LAROSE causing the incident.  As the vessel’s wheelhouse was directly below the lowering bridge, from the master's view, the master could not tell that the bridge was lowering onto the vessel until he felt the impact from above.   Following the incident, the vessel proceeded to Main Iron Works in Houma, Louisiana, near MM 50 of the Gulf Intracoastal Canal Waterway for repair.  U. S. Coast Guard District 8 Bridges Division was notified.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the bridge operator wrongfully lowered the bridge before the tow cleared the bridge span opening.  This caused the bridge to hit and damage the UTV LAROSE's mast pole.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:  (1) Poor communication between the bridge tender and the vessel's master as the master thanked the bridge tender via Channel 13 before his vessel cleared the span.  The master thanked the bridge tender too early and the bridge tender began to lower the bridge after being thanked; (2) Failure of the bridge tender to visually verify that the entire tow cleared the bridge span before lowing the bridge onto the vessel.  To help prevent a reoccurrence, it is suggested vessels designate a lift bridge lookout to notify the master immediately if the bridge is mistakenly lowered onto the vessel's wheel house.  Due to restricted overhead view from the wheelhouse, the master didn't notice the bridge lowering until the first impact.  Consider, had the bridge tender started to lower the bridge seconds earlier or if the tow was moving a ¼ mile slower, the vessel's wheel house could have been impacted and this casualty could have been a lot worse.",LA,Lafourche Parish,['BAYOU LAFOURCHE'],['West Larose Bridge'],['LAROSE'],"29.56904,-90.38547"

The Houston Ship Channel (HSC)  is marked by lights, lighted ranges, buoys, and day beacons, with several large vehicle bridges spanning the waterway. The Interstate 610 Bridge is located near the terminus of the HSC.  SATURN is a 529-foot, 16,162 gross-ton motor vessel with two self-service cranes onboard. 

As indicated on SATURN's ""General Arrangement"" plan, the vessel's maximum height from the bottom of the keel to the top of the mast was 147.99 ft. This figure is listed on and used in the pilot card, ships particulars, loading computer program, and the ""wheelhouse poster"" on the bridge. The master and chief mate trusted the accuracy of this information and used it to calculate SATURN's air draft before transiting to City Dock 21. The SATURN's officers calculated the air draft at 127.78 feet which was satisfactory since the listed clearance height of the 610 bridge is 135 feet, giving the SATURN more than 7 feet of clearance, theoretically. 

Unfortunately, the SATURN struck the underside of the 610 bridge while attempting to transit beneath it, destroying her anchor light and an INMARSAT-c antenna. After analyzing both SATURN's ""navigational lights and masthead"" plan and measuring the height of the mast by hand,  the crew determined that the listed height of 147.99 feet in the ""General Arrangement"" was inaccurate. The actual overall height of the vessel was determined to be 157.48 ft. Consequently, with the vessel's aft draft of 20.34 feet, SATURN's air draft was actually 137.14 feet, more than 2 feet taller than the required clearance height. It's uncertain why SATURN's overall height on the ""General Arrangement"" plan was inaccurate. However, both the master and chief mate are correcting all inaccurate air draft postings and notifying the company/owner of the issue to thwart additional bridge allisions from taking place.

A vessel surveyor estimated the damage to the barge to be $8,000. Norfolk Southern’s engineer surveyed the bridge and gave a preliminary estimate of $350,000. 

Luck Stone’s safety coordinator provided CG-2692, Report of Marine Casualty. Luck Stone's site supervisor conducted alcohol and chemical testing on the crane operator and the two employees on the barge within the time requirements for a Serious Marine Incident. The results were received.

As a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the ATLAS THREE setting adrift. The subsequent event was the allision of the barge with the Norfolk Southern No.7 Railroad Bridge. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) Failure of the company to create written procedures for the barge operations; (2) Increased danger from high wind gusts; (3) Failure of employees to keep positive control of barge; (4) Inadequate defense - improperly tied mooring line; (5) Missing defense - lack of assist tugs.

The CAPTAIN HENRY KNOTT was towing 7 empty hopper barges in a pushing ahead configuration. The uninspected towing vessel CAPTAIN RON L (O.N. 628726) was secured to the front of the towing configuration by cables and acting as a guide of the vessels. As the vessels maneuvered northbound on the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River, the mate called the bridge tender to make arrangements to pass through. The bridge was down due to a passing train. After the train passed, the bridge remained closed for an additional 20 min. The vessels moved slowly in the vicinity to station keep near the bridge. Once open, the vessels proceeded through. The barges were set onto the fender system and the port bow of the forward port barge allided with the fender. No pollution or injuries were reported. Minor dent to the bow of the barge above the waterline. Estimated damage to the fender was $35,000.

As a result of the preliminary investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event was the allision of the VMC 219 with the south fender of the Norfolk Southern No. 5 Railroad Bridge. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) Delayed opening of the bridge, (2) Failure of the mate to ensure proper realignment with the bridge, (3) Impacts of the wind on the empty barges, and (4) Narrow bridge span for the width of the tow.

7100455,29.73353,-90.12767,"On 22 November 2020 at approximately 2122 CST, the tow of the inspected towing vessel (ITV) TRENT JOSEPH (U.S. Flag, O.N. 1055480, 67') allided with the Leo Kerner (Barataria) swing bridge, located at mile marker 36 on Bayou Barataria. The vessel was transiting southbound on the waterway toward Barataria Bay with the cement barge KS 4513 (U.S. Flag, O.N. 1228278) and crane barge JMSS MOBILE (U.S. Flag, O.N. 1206509) in stern tow and the ITV GEORGE C (U.S. Flag, O.N. 1237510) as the tail boat. Following the allision, the bridge was damaged and knocked from its gear pedestal, and the waterway was closed to traffic. No significant damage was reported to any of the involved vessels. No injuries or pollution were reported.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event was the over-rotation of the Leo Kerner swing bridge. The bridge was normally in the closed position and only opened when a vessel needed to transit the channel. The bridge was opened by the bridge tender at the request of the TRENT JOSEPH's master, however the bridge over-rotated by approximately 30 inches which impinged on the navigable portion of the waterway and the required navigation lighting was missing from the east fender system. As a result of the master's inability to see navigation lights on the east fender, he contacted the bridge tender to confirm the tow must pass east of the span. The bridge tender confirmed passing to the east side of the span and suggested using the vessel spotlights to light the fenders. The master did so, but could not see the bridge structure until the vessel was approximately 100 feet from the bridge. As a result, the TRENT JOSEPH steered closer to the visible lighting on the bridge span and the aft port corner of the JMSS MOBILE made contact with the end corner of the horizontal girder and deck planks of the over-rotated bridge.

Drug and alcohol testing of the master and deckhand of the TRENT JOSEPH was conducted following the incident and determined not a factor in the allision. A 96-hour work/rest history was not conducted. The Coast Guard Investigator deemed that work/rest was not a causative or potential factor in the allision.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the incident met the reportable marine casualty criteria in 46 CFR 4.05-1. The level of investigative effort was an enhanced investigation, a serious marine incident, and a major marine casualty investigation as the property damage exceeded $500,000.

Approximately ten minutes prior to the casualty, the master of the towing vessel called for a bridge tender for an opening, the tender was only able to open the East side of the bridge but kept the west side down because an inspection was occurring for the bridge. Once the East side of the bridge was opened, the master of the towing vessel attempted the transit, but due to the angle of the barge on the transit the aft port-side spud struck the bridge. No structural damage occurred to the bridge or the barge. The bridge suffered chipped paint, after being recently re-painted. No injuries, pollution or other incident occurred as a result of this casualty.

The barge is outfitted with four spuds (long steel bars) at each corner of the barge that when lowered are used to hold the barge in place and thus anchoring the barge to the lake bottom allowing a stable work platform. The spuds stand at approximately 15 feet above the deck when fully retracted. The barge normally operates with the spuds fully retracted and will typically only lower the spuds when at the construction site. The barge had approximately 17 feet of air draft at the time of the casualty. 

As a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the striking of the bridge by the aft port-side spud. The causal and human factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) the master of the towing vessel failing to wait for a full bridge lift instead of attempting to transit with only a partial lift, (2) the master of the towing vessel misjudging the angle the barge would need to clear the bridge ; and (3) the height of the spuds above the barge heightened the air-draft and thus increased the likelihood of striking the bridge.",OH,Lorain County,['Black River'],['Charles Berry Bridge'],"['MISS SHEILA', 'ANCHOR DAY']","41.46978,-82.17563"
7103577,36.77525,-76.29577,"At approximately 0800 LMT, on November 29, 2020, the inspected towing vessel DEFENDER (ON: 651977) was towing astern an anchor barge, a pontoon barge and 700 feet of dredge pipe, southbound on the Elizabeth River. The DEFENDER was headed toward the Gilmerton Bridge. The uninspected towing vessel THUNDER (ON: 1236320) assisted the tow on the port side near the middle of the dredge pipe section. The inspected towing vessel BOBBIE ANN (ON: 510349) assisted the tow from the stern of the dredge pipe section. The master of the DEFENDER directed his deckhand to serve as a lookout on the bridge for the tow aft of the vessel. The master of the DEFENDER was also in radio communications with the masters of the other two vessels via VHF. The weather was clear and sunny with no wind. The tide had just passed slack tide and was ebbing in a north-west direction.

As the master of the DEFENDER prepared to transit through the Gilmerton Bridge, he made a right-hand turn. The master navigated the vessel just right of the center of the channel to avoid having the ebb set the tow to port. The THUNDER was positioned on the outside of the turn, pushing the dredge pipe to the inside in order to avoid an allision with the east fender. The master of the BOBBIE ANN was pushing the stern of the dredge pipe to the outside of the turn, guiding it toward the middle of the channel. As the master of the THUNDER pushed the dredge pipe, it pivoted along the point of contact and the front section of the dredge pipe swung to starboard, pushing the pontoon barge in the same direction. The deckhand was talking with the master, and failed to notice the pontoon barge approaching the bridge fender. The master of the DEFENDER was focused ahead of the vessel and advised the deckhand that he could not train him at that time. The master of the BOBBIE ANN notified the master of the DEFENDER via VHF that the tow was looking good, referring to the stern of the tow. The master of the DEFENDER understood it to mean that the tow was clearing the bridge on all points and continued ahead.

At approximately 0934 LMT on November 29, 2020, the barges in the tow allided with the Gilmerton Bridge west bank fender scraping the surface of the rubber, resulting in $164 worth of damage. The master of the DEFENDER notified Sector Virginia Command Center and submitted form CG-2692, Report of Marine Casualty. 

As a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of the uninspected barges with the Gilmerton Bridge. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) Excessive force applied to tow by assist tug; (2) Inattention error – deckhand was distracted and failed to observe the tow; (3) Inattention error - master failed to ensure lookout was attentive; and (4) Communication error – wrong interpretation of assist vessel master communication.

As the tow was going through the Gilmerton Bridge it started “crabbing” to the port side which resulted in an allision with the fendering system. As the barge struck the fendering system, it bounced off and continued transiting through the bridge span when it struck the fendering system a second time.

The incident occurred as the tow was transiting southbound at high tide en route to Savannah, GA. As the tow approached the swing bridge (about a mile from bridge), the Master of GRACE MYRICK was about to contact the bridge tender to request a bridge opening when he heard the operator of the crew boat behind the GRACE MYRICK radioed the swing bridge operator asking to open the bridge for vessel transit. The swing bridge operator agreed to the bridge opening and relayed that the bridge was going to open for the vessel ahead of them (GRACE MYRICK) and leave it open for the crew boat and other vessels behind. The swing bridge operator then initiated the opening process of the swing bridge. The swing bridge is controlled by a computer and the bridge operator follows the opening sequence by the visual display in the monitor. From start to finish, the opening sequence takes about five minutes (approx. 3 minutes for the bridge to complete its turn). It has happened in the past when the bridge rarely experienced technical problems during the opening sequence, however the bridge operator can override the system, which only adds a couple seconds to the bridge opening. 

During the bridge opening, the swing bridge operator was alerted by the system of a fault with the Jack No.2. (the jacks lift the bridge to allow the retraction of end wedges on the east and west underside of the bridge), which is located on the west side of the bridge. After the swing bridge operator engaged the override, the bridge continued on its automatic opening cycle. The Master of the GRACE MYRICK continued on course at the slowest speed the tow could maintain since the ICW was at high tide and the current was about to 2-3 knots. As the tow began to get closer to the bridge and the bridge was still in the process to open, the Master backed down the throttle to stop the momentum of the tow. This caused the Master to begin losing control of the barges as they were set by the current. The stern of the tow drifted to the starboard as the Master attempted to align the barges through the bridge opening. The bridge was fully open and in locked position as the lead barge (STEVENS 1601) approached the bridge opening (about 100 yards from bridge). The lookout, who was posted on the lead barge, provided measurement distances of the fendering system to the Master and had to move around from port to starboard side and over cargo to relay distances to the Master. The Master put the throttle ahead and started to regain control of the tow, and was able to get the lead barge through the opening without incidents. However, the lookout was not able to get around the deck cargo in time to see down the second barge as it was coming through the fendering system. As the tow continued transiting through the bridge, the starboard bow of the MYRICK 13060 allided with the starboard fendering system. The GRACE MYRICK made it through the bridge without alliding with fendering system. The Master continued with its transit along the ICW as he was not able to stop due to the current and other vessels coming behind the tow. The Master thought the damage was minimal and did not call the swing bridge operator to request a damage report. The Master of the GRACE MYRICK stated that the swing bridge operator did not radio them to report damages, but the swing bridge operator stated that he tried to call the GRACE MYRICK on channel 13 and 16 without a response. Approximately 30 feet of the fendering system boarding along the bulkhead were broken or damaged as well as multiple steel I-beam fendering supports. The deckhands checked the voids on the MYRICK 13060, but found no water ingress. The only recognizable damage was an inset and paint scrapes. Coast Guard Waterways was notified of a potential navigational hazard as a portion of a steel I-beam support was submerged during high tide and no longer protected with boards after the allision.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the tow drifting sideways after the throttle was put on full astern. This was followed by the barge allision with the bridge fendering system. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty were: (1) current conditions, (2) inability of lookout to freely move about barges with deck cargo restricting movement on deck, (3) only one lookout posted, and (4) complacency/situational awareness - delay to request a bridge opening.

During the approach to the bridge the vessel encountered wind gust of 40 mph and a strong funnel current.  These strong winds and current caused the bow of the barge swing outwards and the starboard side of the barge allided with the bridge causing damage to the fender system of the bridge. The operator of the towing vessel moored the vessel at the nearest marina and fled the towing vessel. He failed to notify the operator and the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard was notified two days later by a witness. The owner was called by the duty IO regarding the incident, the owner did not know about the incident until notified by the duty IO. When asked for the contact information of the operator the day of the incident, the owner did not have any information. The owner states that he only speaks to the operator in person and tells him of the job on site. The operator does not have any information in MISLE or MMLD.  A CG-2692 was submitted by the owner of the towing vessel. Initial damage of bridge is $21,000.

As a result of this investigation the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the barge being sucked into the current and alliding with the bridge. The causal factor that contributed to this casualty was heavy wind gusts and a strong current.

In aggravation: The incident occurred on November 11, 2020 and was not reported to the Coast Guard until November 13, 2020; as result, an enforcement referral has been initiated for failure to immediately notify.

The vessel was transiting westbound in the Rigolets Pass as part of a transit to Port Bienville, MS and was pushing the SH 238 (ON: CG054302, 195-foot by 35-foot uninspected hopper barge, unloaded). 

The swing bridge was normally in the closed position and only opened when a vessel needed to pass though the Rigolets Pass channel. The bridge was manned locally. When the ITV's pilot requested passage, the bridge tender advised that he would open the bridge after two trains passed. While maintaining position east of the bridge, the ITV captain relieved the pilot as the person in control of the vessel. The captain called the bridge tender after seeing the two trains pass, requesting that the bridge be opened. The bridge tender told the captain that they were going to get the bridge open, but the captain mistook this communication, believing the bridge was open and proceeded with the tow to transit through the bridge. Approximately 1-2 minutes before the allision, the captain saw that the swing span was not completely open and unsuccessfully attempted to stop. The coaming on the forward port side of the barge struck the overhanging south (when open) end of the swing span. The allision damaged the forward port side of the barge, with indentations and cracks to the port side forward bow and port side forward hopper coaming, which cost approximately $5,000 to repair. Damage to the bridge included the swing span's structure and components, the equipment used to open and close the swing span, and electrical and cabling components, which cost approximately $1.1M to repair.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of the ITV ROBERT CENAC's tow with the CSX Railroad Rigolets Swing Bridge. The vessel master thought the bridge was in the open position when he attempted to transit through the bridge. The communication between the vessel master and bridge tender regarding the opening of the bridge was misunderstood by the vessel master. The partially open bridge was not identified by the vessel master because the bridge was missing required navigation lighting marking each end and the top center of the bridge span.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the incident met the reportable marine casualty criteria in 46 CFR 4.05-1 as an unintended strike with a bridge occurred.

Throughput at the Loundon Dam was documented at approximately 45000 CFS.  Down to less than 1 mph in the current, the vessel began to lose steerage. Seeing that the vessel was losing steerage and the tow head was becoming lined up to possibly allide with the subsequent Highway 11 Bridge, the master turned to port attempting to regain steerage. The tow began to top around to port (toward the RDB) and the master was unable to regain control.  The tow allided with the upstream bridge pier footings of the Southern Railroad Bridge and became parallel with the bridge, pinned by the current. For the safety of the vessel and crew, the master directed the vessel to be uncoupled from the tow.

The tow started heading west along the Bayou Shaffer and then turned north on the Atchafalaya River.  Almost immediately after the tow turned north on the River, it approached the Bayou Boeuf Rail Road Bridge travelling at approximately 1 knot.  As the tow was passing under the bridge, crewmembers stated that the wind caught the lead barge DOIRON.  This in turn caused the port quarter of the barge to allide with the east bridge fender.

As the tow was passing under the HWY 182 Bridge, the top of the spuds on board the CAJUN INTEGRITY struck the span of the bridge.  The allision with the bridge brought the forward momentum of the ITV MR MAX to a stop and it took approximately 1 minute for the spuds to clear the bridge as it scraped along the bottom of the bridge.  The air draft of the spuds onboard the deck barge was 48 feet from the deck.  When the crew was preparing to depart the dock for the voyage, both the Captain and Pilot were concerned about the height of the HWY 182 Bridge.  Company personnel told the vessel crew that the spud barge height was 48 feet.  After the tow was underway and en route to pass under the bridge, the Pilot contacted Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) Berwick Bay and asked for the height of the bridge.  The VTS watch stander reported the bridge to be 50 feet. 

When investigators arrived to the spud barge, it was found there was no damage to the barge.  Company personnel were there and stated that they verified the spuds on the barge were 48 feet.  Investigators noticed the drafts of the barge was approximately 6.5 feet, which left approximately 6 feet of freeboard on the barge.  Therefore, the total air draft of the spuds on the CAJUN INTEGRITY was 54 feet and the charted height of the HWY 182 bridge is charted at 50 feet.  Minimal damage to the spuds was reported by the surveyors that required welding of the eyelets at the top of the spud but did not affect the spuds operational status.  There was no report of any pollution or injuries as a result of the incident.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the spuds on the CAJUN INTEGRITY and the HWY 182 Bridge.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:

(1) The Captain not taking into account the freeboard of the CAJUN INTEGRITY in determining the total air draft of the spuds on the barge.

Other areas of concern:  Investigators asked to see the vessel's navigation assessment, aka voyage plan, for the voyage including the time of the casualty.  One was not created.  In fact, only one voyage plan was found on board dated February 13, 2021.  While this could have been a causal factor, investigators believed that even with a completed voyage plan this incident would have still occurred due to the Captain's failure to consider the barge's freeboard when calculating air draft. 

The Captain recently was out of work for approximately 1 month due to health concerns.  Investigators questioned him about his medical conditions and the prescriptions prescribed to him.  The Captain stated he was in the process of renewing his MMC and medical certificate and investigators advised him to ensure he disclosed all medications and conditions to the National Maritime Center.

Bridge manager stated attempts to contact the involved vessel were unsuccessful and the Coast Guard did not receive a report of the casualty from the vessel operator.  Following the report, Investigating Officer conducted an investigation and observed blue paint on Longboat Pass Bridge fender system timbers consistent with the markings of the barge JUSTIN HUNTER, a vessel converted to be self-propelled from a deck barge by the addition of a hydraulic power unit. Investigating Officer was unable to approach JUSTIN HUNTER due to operation in shallow water.  

On March 29, 2021, Investigating Officer received subsequent notification alleging a second allision involving the Longboat Pass Bridge and the JUSTIN HUNTER.  Bridge Tender was able to provide accurate description of JUSTIN HUNTER as crew made temporary repairs to fender system.  Bridge Tender observed JUSTIN HUNTER operating as a self-propelled vessel.  

Investigating Officer contacted the manager of JUSTIN HUNTER and confirmed the vessel is a 140-foot long barge operating as a self-propelled vessel with two hydraulically driven auxiliary power units.  The manager confirmed the barge was over 5 tons, denied knowledge of the alleged allisions with the Longboat Pass Bridge and was unaware of the requirement to notify the Coast Guard of the allision.  During this conversation, the Investigating Officer discovered the JUSTIN HUNTER did not have a certificate of Documentation with a Coastwise Endorsement which is required since the vessel was operating as a self-propelled vessel while conducting Coastwise Trade, in accordance with 46 CFR Part 67.  Removal of the propulsion unit made JUSTIN HUNTER exempt from documentation requirements while operating on inland waters of the United States.  Furthermore, if JUSTIN HUNTER were measured by the Standard Measurement System as defined by 46 CFR Part 69, it would likely exceed 300 gross tons and if self-propelled, would require inspection under 46 CFR Subchapter I.  The auxiliary power units were subsequently removed from the vessel.

The LAURA LEE is 64.5 feet, 79 gross tons, blue wood hull, built in 1970, owned/operated by Bay Shore Fishing Corp.,and Coast Guard certificated to carry 128 passengers.

The while the vessel was stemming the out going tide(1.5 knots),the wind speed gusted to 6.1 knots and the LAURA LEE had struck the concrete bridge structure on the vessel’s starboard side, 2nd void, just below the vessel's rub-rail and sustained damages to four frames and hull planks located above the waterline. The crew immediately assessed the seaworthiness and damage to the vessel and found no ingress of water or bilge alarms activated, and no injury to passengers. They made the decision to return to the dock, located at Captree Boat Basin, Captree, NY. At the time of the incident, the crew could not ascertain the severity of the damage until the following day. The vessel was hauled out of the water at Shellfish Marina in West Sayville, NY on November 4, 2020 and was identified by a passing Coast Guard (CG) Marine Inspector (MI) attached to the Marine Safety Detachment (MSD) Coram as one of the inspected small passenger vessels belonging to their fleet of responsibility. Coast Guard Sector Long Island Sound Command Center or MSD Coram never received the notification of the LAURA LEE un-intentionally alliding with the RMC-FI Inlet Bridge. On November 5, 2020, The CG MI was informed and recommended that they should attend the vessel since it was involved in an allision with a concrete bridge fendering system by a local shipwright; this was the first time the CG MI heard of this incident. 

The Bridge Maintenance Program Engineer with the New York State Department of Transportation, Long Island Region was notified of the allision on November 9, 2020 and the FI Inlet Bridge was inspected by the Bridge maintenance engineer and found no signs of structural damage to the bridge, but found blue paint scrapes along the bridge structure.  

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of the LAURA LEE with the Robert Moses Causeway-Fire Island Inlet Bridge. This was followed by the hull damage to the vessel. The causal factor that contributed to this casualty is the wind gust that occurred while the vessel was stemming the out going tide between bridge abutments.

The Master was pushed toward the starboard side in the current and could not change course, forcing him to use to allide with the bridge fendering system and then pivot on the fendering system to line the tug and barge up to continue thru. The POTOMAC was initially going approximately 5 knots and then down to 2 knots, then made contact at about 1 knot or less. After making contact with the bridge, the POTOMAC continued on their voyage and did not make reports to the bridge allision. The bridge operator made a report of damage to the bridge.

Drug and alcohol testing were completed, with negative results.   

As a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event was the allision of DOUBLE SKIN 50 being pushed by the POTOMAC to the Raritan Railroad Bridge.

7306694,29.72883,-90.12449,"On 30 August 2021 at approximately 0015 local time, during Hurricane Ida, an unmanned and undocumented deck barge J137UF (CG1704013), the sunken fishing vessel THREE PIGEONS (ON: 909533), and the uninspected towing vessel (UTV) AUDREY (ON: 505188) allided with the south side of the Leo Kerner swing bridge, across the Barataria waterway in Lafitte La. None of the vessels involved received significant damage. The Leo Kerner Bridge sustained significant damage and was placed out of service to vehicles and marine traffic. This casualty was reported by the local sheriff, the Coast Guard did not receive the required immediate notification of this casualty from the vessel or barge owner/operator. 

On 29 August 2021, the barge J137UF was moored at Tom’s Marine and Salvage, a salvage and shipyard operation on the Barataria waterway. The barge was secured to 3 piles driven into the mud on its south side, and tied to the super structures of CFV THREE PIGEONS and a second unnamed fishing vessel on its north side. Both fishing vessels were salvaged vessels that were already sunken. The barge and fishing vessels were all located on the south end of the Tom’s Marine property near the east bank of the Barataria Bay Waterway in anticipation of the arrival of Hurricane Ida. The UTV SUPER T and UTV AUDREY were moored and manned at the main dock at Tom’s Marine to respond during the hurricane.

As the hurricane made landfall, the accompanying storm surge raised the water level in the area between 8-10 feet, and reversed the waterway current causing it to flow upstream. According to the National Weather Service, the New Orleans metro area experienced tropical storm (34 knots/39 mph) force winds or higher from 0600 Sunday 29 Aug 21 to 0600 Monday 30 Aug 21. Highest recorded wind speed was a gust of 78 knots at 2037 on 29 Aug 21 and a maximum sustained wind of 54 knots on Sunday the 29th at 1740, before the wind gauges failed. 

As the water level rose, at 2350, the barge J137UF lifted the sunken fishing vessels off the bottom, and rose above the piles allowing the barge and both fishing vessels to become adrift. At approximately 0000 on 30 Aug 21, the Captain/owner of the UTV AUDREY reported that he saw the barge and fishing vessel drift past him headed towards the bridge. UTV AUDREY and UTV SUPER T left the dock to attempt to stop the barge and fishing vessels. The Captains reported that due to wind and current they were unable to catch the barge, and they attempted to return to the shipyard. Due to the extreme weather, neither vessel was able to proceed downstream and were instead blown towards the bridge. The SUPER T grounded on the east side of the waterway, while the AUDREY was pushed into the corner of the barge and the west side of the Leo Kerner bridge's approach span. Both vessels were abandoned in their location for the duration of the storm.

The THREE PIGEONS allided with and came to rest against the center span of the bridge, while the J137UF made contact with the lower chord of the western side of the bridge, and the AUDREY became wedged under the western approach span of the bridge. The unnamed fishing vessel was found north of the bridge, but contact with the bridge could not be verified. The bridge was pushed off of its foundation towards the north, and the western approach span was lifted off of its support caps. DOT engineers later deemed the bridge unserviceable, and estimated $4.2 million for temporary repairs and over $20 million for permanent repairs.  The damaged bridge was replaced by an ACROW temporary bridge, until a new long-term replacement can be built. 

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the incident met the reportable marine casualty criteria in 46 CFR 4.05-1 as the allision resulted in property damage that exceeded the $75,000 threshold.

The barge was slightly to the starboard side of the bridge channel before entering the wooden bridge fendering area also known as the dolphin and whale plank fender section of the channel. While approaching the bridge, the towing vessel began decreasing in knots to align the tow with the bridge channel but was unable to make the alignment which led to the starboard bow quarter of the 7015 barge to allide with the bridge fendering system. MISTER T then backed the backed the 7015 to realign the configuration which allowed the MISTER T and the 7015 to transit under the bridge without any further incident.

The vessel was enroute to Colonna’s Shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia and the intended route required the vessel to transit beneath both the Norfolk Southern # 7 railroad bridge in addition to the Gilmerton bridge. Both bridges run parallel to each other, are approximately 15 feet apart, and are required to be lifted to allow the ISLAND TRADER to successfully pass underneath. The Mate made radio contact with the tender for each bridge and requested a lift with approximately 20 minutes of transit time left to the bridge complex. The tender for the Gilmerton bridge reported that the Gilmerton Bridge would be open at the same time as the Norfolk Southern # 7. Once the tow arrived at the bridge complex, the tender of the Norfolk Southern # 7 reported that the bridge was open and gave the vessel approval to pass. The Mate transited the tow into the draw of the bridge span but did not realize the Gilmerton Bridge still had not opened.

The incident occurred as the tow was transiting southbound at low tide. As the tow approached the swing bridge, the Mate contacted the bridge tender to request an opening, and posted the deckhand as lookout on the port side of CAPT RICHARD. The tow was approximately 60 feet wide while the bridge opening was approximately 80 feet wide. The Mate slowed the tow to approximately 2-3 knots and waited for the bridge opening. The bridge opened without error and on time. The Mate then slowed down to .5 knots as the tow went through the bridge opening. As the tow entered the opening, the current beset the stern of the DMO LISTO to starboard, which caused the tow to be push towards the northern fendering system. The Mate knew he did not have much room and used the lead barge, DERRICK 16, to push off the fendering system. The Mate then set the stern of DMO LISTO to port in order to use the port quarter of CAPT RICHARD to rub against the southern fendering system. The second push on the fendering system brought the tow back into the middle of the channel. The Mate slowed to a stop after clearing the bridge and spoke to the bridge who verified no damages to both fendering system. There was no damages to the tug and/or barge.

The incident occurred as the tow was transiting northbound en route to Chesapeake, VA with four crew aboard. As the tow approached the swing bridge, the Master of JOHN PARRISH made contact with the bridge tender and requested a bridge opening. The bridge operator agreed and initiated the opening process of the swing bridge. The swing bridge is controlled by a computer and the bridge operator follows the opening sequence by the visual display in the monitor. From start to finish, the opening sequence takes about five minutes (approx. 3 minutes for the bridge to complete its turn). No problems were reported with the opening of the bridge or its operation. 

The Master of JOHN PARRISH continued on course at the slowest speed since the ICW was at high tide and the current was about to 2-3 knots flowing in the direction of the tow. As the tow began to get closer to the bridge, the Master centered up the barges and tug (approximately 2000’ prior) with the assistance of two lookouts, which were standing forward near the bow of NDC 160 for the purpose of communicating distance, providing guidance, and to line up for transit through the more restrictive bridge draw area. 

As the Master continued on course, he placed both throttles back to idle to take more speed off when he noted a strong following tide and the tow was still maintaining speed despite the change in handle position (placing throttles to idle). At this time, the lookout noticed the tow had drifted off center and was closer to the starboard side of the fendering system and contacted the Master over handheld radio (channel 18) to come more to port. The Master acknowledge the communication. At approximately 200’ from the bridge, the Master started taking the port and starboard main engines in and out of gear, as he had done in the past successfully to assist with slowing the tow and for making course corrections. The tow shifted, but was not notable.

At approximately 70’ from the entrance to the fendering system, the Master saw the tow was still too close to the east fendering system, and made a slight turn and gave a throttle increase to port. The lookouts again, notified the Master the tow needed to come more to port. As the tow transited through the bridge, the first barge (DIADAPPER 78) made it through without incident; however, the starboard bow corner of NDC 160 allided with the east fendering system. After the allision occurred, the Master had both main engines at clutch and then gave slight throttle and turned the rudder to ease off the fender. This caused the port side of NDC 160 to shift and allide with the western fendering before finial clearing of the bridge.   

The tow made it through the bridge without any further incident and pushed up on the western bank approximately one half a mile until morning. The Master had the lookouts check all voids on the tug and both barges. No damage, injuries, or pollution was reported to the tug or barges. 

The swing bridge operator called the Master of JOHN PARRISH and notified both sides of the fendering had been struck and had visible damage. Approximately 10 feet of the fendering system, including boarding along the bulkhead on the east side was broken and missing. Additionally, a navigational light, wiring, and fender supports were damaged and missing. The bridge tender notified the Coast Guard due to the potential hazard to navigational, as the navigational light was extinguished and boards were missing.

The vessel was transiting from the Halliburton Dock in Berwick, LA to Galveston, TX pushing four red flag barges loaded with liquid mud. However, the vessel was restricted by the highwater conditions for transiting through the Morgan City Triple Span Bridges set forth by the Local Notice to Mariner 15/22. Since there were no available assist vessels in the area to assist in the transit through the bridges, the relief captain decided to break up the tow and ferry two barges at a time down to Central Boat Rentals, before remaking the tow and heading to Texas. The ITV CAPTAIN BOUDREAUX was making its run southbound with the first two barges (LMB 109 and LMB 103) when the stern barge LMB 103 allided with the northeast section of the fendering system of the Morgan City Railroad Bridge. The relief captain was aware of the current shifting the tow when transiting through the Railroad Bridge but had only transited southbound without an assist vessel a couple of times. Upon questioning, the relief captain stated that he knew that he was supposed to stay on the western side of the channel when transiting through the bridge because of the current. However, he decided to transit in the middle of the channel because he believed the tow was small enough to not be affected by the current. The vessel was transiting at approximately 7 mph following a current that was approximately 2 mph. When the relief captain realized that the tow was being sucked to the eastern side of the channel towards the Railroad Bridge, he attempted to reverse but still allided with the fendering system. The impact of the allision resulted in two broken tow wires and scrapes to the port stern of the LMB 109. The tow wires were replaced with extras kept onboard. There was only minimal damage to the fendering system reported by BNSF. There was no report of any pollution or injuries as a result of this incident. 

During the course of the investigation it was discovered that the relief captain did not have the radar observer endorsement on his credentials. The company was notified of the missing endorsement and educated on ensuring all credentialed mariners had the proper endorsement for the position hired. The vessel was allowed to retrieve the last two barges from Halliburton Dock and remake it tow under the captain with the proper credentials while the company determined the best route for continuing transit with only one fully credentialed captain. After determining to transit back to Texas using only the master as the qualified captain of the vessel in 12 hour shifts, the vessel was allowed to continue its transit by the marine inspectors at MSU Morgan City (MISLE# 7433600).

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the tank barge LMB 103 and the Morgan City Railroad Bridge while it was being pushed by the ITV CAPTAIN BOUDREAUX. The casual factors that contributed to this casualty include:
1) The miscalculation of the relief captain in maneuvering the ITV CAPTAIN BOUDREAUX under the Morgan City Railroad Bridge that resulted in the tow being pulled towards the eastern side of the channel and into the fendering system of the Morgan City Railroad Bridge.
2) The high water conditions of the waterways that increased the current flowing south through the Bridge complex and created a suction effect near the fendering system of the bridge that pulled the tow towards the eastern side of the channel.",LA,St. Mary Parish,['IWW-ALT'],['MORGAN CITY SP RR BRIDGE'],"['LMB 103', 'CAPTAIN BOUDREAUX']","29.69285,-91.21158"

The Capt was able to work the ITV off of ground; however, once he was free the head of the tow had topped around towards the left descending bank (LDB). With the tow almost perpendicular to the flow of the UMR, it drifted down onto the Merchants Bridge and allided with a mooring cell set up on the north side of the IL side bridge pier of the center span. The allision caused the tow to break apart into a single block of 6 barges and 4 individual barges. The Capt was able to recover the block of 6 and 1 of the adrift barges and take them down to the SCF-Lewis and Clark - MRT Fleet at MM 182.0 without further incident; however, the 3 remaining individual barges (ED 1, O.N: 1030817; CTC0119, O.N: 1109839; MEM 5129, O.N: 1066471) floated down river and allided with the McKinley Bridge at MM 182.5. Two assist boats working downriver were able to corral the 3 adrift barges and take them in tow to the same MRT Fleet as the GARRON L SNEED. 
 
The tow was destined for a coal dock along the right descending bank (RDB) at MM 184.5 and had to utilize the alternate span (center span) of the bridge to avoid the L-dike that protrudes from the tip of the peninsula at MM 184.2 running south to MM 183.3 which separates the Chain of Rocks from the Chain of Rock Canal. As the tow was approaching the center span, the Capt set the tow off a bit further from the MO side pier of the center span due to a moored work-flat (barge), M-8003 (O.N. CG867290). Once the head of the tow was clear of the bridge span the winds picked up from 5 kts to approx. 10-15 kts off of the portside of the tow (from West).  Additionally the natural flow of the river had the current pushing on the portside head of the tow which aided in setting him off to the starboard. The resulting grounding caused the ITV to breach the #3 starboard fuel tank and barge breakaway caused damage to the 3 adrift barges that allided with the McKinley Bridge.

The casualty occurred while the vessel was transiting SB pushing 15 loaded dry cargo barges for Marquette Transportation at MM 539 UMR.  As the vessel was transiting around a bend in the river. A strong current of approximately 2 mph pushed the head of the tow to port and caused the vessel to run aground on an island in the river located just outside the channel on the LDB with its port beam.  

Upon running aground the connection wires for the tow separated and 09 barges broke loose from the tow and began drifting downriver. Sector UMR issued a W/W restriction via an SMIB for MM 544-534 UMR. 06 barges remained connected to the vessel as it was grounded.

The group of 03 drifting barges allided with the Highway 52 Bridge at MM 538 and as a results, the barge which experienced the allision (AGS 717) was separated from the other two. This separated barge drifted into a wing dike on the LDB at MM 536 where it ran aground. 

An assist vessel, the ITV WILLIAM E LAWSON (O.N. 626510), was in the area and was requested to assist in recovery of the breakaway barges.  The assist vessel was able to successfully recover all remaining 08 breakaway barges at MM 537.  The JONATHAN ERICKSON was able to become ungrounded under its own power after approximately 30 minutes and then began transiting SB to meet with the assist vessel at MM 537 where it reconfigured the 08 recovered barges back into the tow.  The grounded barge appeared to be taking on water and a marine surveyor was requested to come inspect and, if possible, repair any breaches discovered in the hull.  No damage to the other barges or the ITV JONATHAN ERICKSON was reported and only minor damage was discovered on the Highway 52 Bridge which remained fully operational.  No pollution or injuries associated with this incident were reported. Preliminary interview conducted with the vessel master.
  
24APR2022, 1230: Marine surveyor arrived on scene at MM 536 UMR LDB to inspect the barge that had appeared to be damaged (AGS 717).  After inspection, breaches in the hull of the #1 bow void tank (12""x1"") and the #2 port wing tank (18""x1"") were discovered and water was intruding into those voids.  The marine surveyor proceeded to pump the water out of the damaged void tanks and then initiated temporary repairs using wooden shingles and epoxy to temporarily seal the breaches. After temporary repairs were completed, AGS 717 was reincorporated into the original tow as the 2nd barge in the center string. The tow then transited to an ARTCO fleeting area in Clinton, IA at MM 515 UMR and transferred the cargo carried by AGS 717 to an undamaged barge.

Portal bridge was scheduled for two openings on April 16th, 2022, to accommodate passage of the tug and barge vessel Liz Vinik. The first opening for the vessel to proceed north along the Hackensack River occurred at approximately 11:30am without incident and the bridge was closed and OK'd for rail traffic at approximately 11:45am. The second opening for the vessel’s return trip occurred at approximately 2:15pm. As the vessel maneuvered to traverse through the North Channel (inbound channel) below the bridge, it struck the fender, located between the North and South Channels which protects the bridge’s swing span. The vessel ricocheted off the center fender and then struck the fender protecting pier located on the opposite side of the north channel.

As a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event was the allision of the LIZ VINIK's tow to include the barge MARIA with the Portal Bridge fendering structure.

The vessel was transiting north from Belle River, LA to Amelia, LA when the starboard bow allided with the wood fendering system of the railroad bridge. The vessel was going approximately 0.2 mph when it allided with the fendering system. The bridge tender that witnessed the allision noted that the vessel was not properly lined up in the channel prior to entering, which caused the port bow of the barge to allide with the fendering system. The vessel then pivoted off the pilings to straighten up the tow to continue through the bridge system. The Bayou Boeuf Railroad bridge has a horizontal span of 56 feet. There was no report of any damages to the barge and minimal damage to one of the wooden planks of the fendering system. There was no report of any injuries or pollution as a result of this incident.

The master of the ITV FRED A SETTOON did not report the allision to the Coast Guard as required by 46 C.F.R. 4.05-1. He did notify the company, Settoon Construction, whom also did not report it to the Coast Guard. Upon further questioning, the company representative stated that he was not aware of the protocols for notifying the Coast Guard after the incident having just started working for the company. Both the mariner and the company have a history of not reporting reportable marine casualties to the Coast Guard and further enforcement will be initiated for both parties.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the deck barge SCOTT A SETTOON JR and the Bayou Boeuf Railroad Bridge fendering system. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:
1) The miscalculation of the master in maneuvering the ITV FRED A SETTOON prior to transiting through the railroad bridge that resulted in the barge not being properly lined up.

The vessel, deck barge, and spud barge as a single unit had drifted south from the Shallow Water Equipment Dock some time during the previous night. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that although the spud barge had been spudded down, there was not enough slack in the line after the yard workers checked on the spuds the evening prior to account for the tidal influence. There was both an increase in the volume of water flowing down though the Bayou Boeuf railroad bridge, in addition to a tidal variance according to the data collected from the USGS. Since there was not enough room in the lines for the spuds to adjust to the changing water levels, the spuds got detached from the river floor and started to drift out into the channel with the attached vessel THE DOMINO. With the increase in water flowing down from the north, THE DOMINO, deck barge, and spud barge drifted in the channel until it came to stop after alliding with the railroad bridge. The allision with the bridge did not result in any damages to either the structure, the towing vessel, or barges.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the breakaway of the spud barge from the dock. This was followed by THE DOMINO, deck barge, and spud barge to be adrift in the waterway that led to the eventual allision with the Bayou Boeuf Railroad Bridge. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include:

1) The improperly spudded down spud barge that did not have enough slack to account for tidal variance and resulted in the vessel and barges to be set adrift in the waterway.
2) The lack of monitoring or notifications to personnel ashore to alert them of the vessel and barges becoming unsecured and drifting into the waterway prior to it finding its way down to the railroad bridge.

One of the pilots was breaking in and on his check ride, the other pilot was the senior evaluator. As they approached the Natchez I-84 Bridge they made a plan to go through the center span. After starting the approach the senior pilot believed the vessel and tow was too close to the right descending bank to make the pass through the center span. He instructed the junior pilot to bring the vessel to starboard and aim for the span closest to the right descending bank. The junior pilot was indecisive and failed to make a decision between the original plan and the updated plan he was instructed to follow from the senior pilot.

The vessel was returning from the Bayou Chene to the dock at Shallow Water Equipment in Amelia, LA pushing the deck barge loaded with two marsh buggies. As the captain was handling the vessel to make it through the west channel of the railroad bridge, he drove the barge straight into the middle of the center pier due to restricted visibility from THE DOMINO's bridge. The captain stated that he could not see the channel clearly due to the marsh buggies blocking his view and was utilizing the verbal cues from a lookout he had on the bow of the barge to maneuver. There were no radars or cameras installed onboard the towing vessel for the captain to utilize. The barge allided with the center pier at approximately 1.2 miles per hour and caused some minor damage to the sign and sign bracket costing around $1200. There was no damage reported on the barge. There was also no report of any injuries or pollution as a result of this incident.

Owner/Operator secured another vessel and safely transported the passengers to shore without any further incident.  As a result of SMI crew was submitted drug & alcohol testing that ended with ""redacted Medical PII"" results for the crew.

Investigation revealed that due to better efficient transit, small craft transiting inbound use the shore side ""wide span"" due to the bridge at the draw is very narrow and difficult to navigate.  Further investigation denoted that with constant development of the adjacent jetty, high tides produce a strong eddy that influence a vessel's navigation transitting the wide spans of the bridge.  To note: only the draw span has fendering structure around the piers while the remaining piers have none in which these spans are regularly transited by local small vessels.

At approximately 1500, vessel was underway with tow assistance from SEA TOW SCOOTER waiting for the bridge to open.  Master alerted Bridge tender of his intent to pass and requested the bridge be opened for his transit.  Bridge tender stated the opening was delayed due to a vehicular traffic. SEA TOW SCOOTER was forced to stop and lost control of it's tow, DAMAGED GOODS, due to the delay. DAMAGED GOODS floated past SEA TOW SCOOTER and allided with the bridge.  The passenger aboard DAMAGED GOODS attempted to push against the bridge to lessen the impact on his vessel. The passenger suffered a laceration on his right arm. Master took up the slack in the tow and came alongside the vessel. Both vessels transited through the bridge opening. Master notified his Supervisor and called for emergency medical services. SEA TOW SCOOTER delivered DAMAGED GOODS to Knickecane Boat Ramp; EMS were standing by.

Bridge tender and Maine DOT confirmed no damage to the abutment and deemed bridge fully functional. No repairs necessary to SEA TOW SCOOTER; minimal exterior repairs were needed for DAMAGED GOODS.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the transom of the DAMAGED GOODS with the South side abutment of Barter's Island Bridge.  The causal factors that led to this casualty include; (1) Delay in Bridge opening due to vehicle traffic stoppage, (2) failure of Master to keep vessel and tow in a safe distance from bridge prior to its opening, and (3) rapid current of the river causing the tow to float beyond the hauler as it approached the bridge opening.",ME,Lincoln County,['Sheepscot River'],['Barters Island Bridge'],"['SEA TOW SCOOTER', 'DAMAGED GOODS']","43.88166,-69.6713"

7559566,30.83687,-87.9447,"On 8/24/2022 the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE, and its 07-barge tow, allided with the CSX 14 Mile Bridge on the Mobile River during its transit under the bridge. 

As the Pilot was navigating the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE and pushing its tow north on the Mobile River, they called the CSX 14 Mile Bridge Tender via VHF-FM Channel 13 and requested/received confirmation of an opening of the CSX 14 Mile Bridge for a passing at approximately 1211 local.  The ITV AMERICAN was pushing 7 barges in a 3-2-2 configuration with the front three being unloaded hopper barges and the two sets of two being loaded barges.

The CSX 14 Mile Bridge Tender is at a remote location in Mobile, Alabama at the State Docks Terminal Railway and monitors the bridge by VHF-FM radio, video.  The video is transmitted via satellite communications with a backup of ""digi"" or cellular signal.  When/if the satellite communications fail, then the ""digi"" system is designed to immediately pick up the communications. One set of sensors on the bridge are beam sensors mounted on the north and south side of the fendering system to alert the remote tender if there is traffic on the river under the bridge.
After the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE requested the CSX 14 Mile Bridge to open, the Bridge Tender checked traffic, opened the bridge, and communicated back to the ITV the bridge was opening.  After opening, the Bridge Tender lost satellite communication and the ""digi"" communications did not immediately connect the video communications with the CSX 14 Mile Bridge.  The Bridge Tender also maintains rail/train traffic from their station at State Docks Terminal Railway and saw a train approaching the CSX 14 Mile Bridge.  As the train approached the bridge, it received the appropriate signals and began to slow, as part of its safety system which detects open bridges. 

The ITV approached the fully opened bridge and began aligning the tow to pass under the bridge.

The Tender saw the approaching train and began closing the bridge, without communicating the bridge closure to the ITV. The bridge begins to lower and then moments later, the lead barges, unloaded hopper barges, of the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE enter the bridge tripping the southern beam sensors. This causes the bridge to stop lowering and remain in a slightly closed position. Following the lead barge where loaded barges, which were sitting low enough in the water to be below the river beam sensors.  From video of the bridge, it appears that the bridge tender resumes closing the bridge once the southern sensors are clear of the unloaded hopper barges. At that point, the bridge tender manually lowered the bridge while the northern beam sensors where still obstructed by the unloaded hopper barges. 

Manually closing the bridge requires the Tender to silence the warning of the bridge’s sensors, which detects when a vessel is under it, and then hit the “Channel not Clear” button twice and the “Close Bridge” button once. The Tender did not have visual on the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE when they manual shut the bridge. 
Onboard the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE, the Pilot was navigating his tow/vessel between the open CSX 14 Mile Bridge fenders when they noticed the bridge closing. At the time the ITV was making approximately 4.2 knots up the river and the front unloaded hopper barges are north of the bridge; the two sets of loaded barges are transiting under the bridge and the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE is approaching the bridge from the south. The Pilot called the Bridge Tender on VHF-FM 13 and received no answer.  The Pilot began backing down the ITV and tow while the bridge was lowering.  Not thinking they would have time to stop before alliding with the bridge the Pilot sounded the collision alarm.  The bridge continued lowering and settled into the closed position.  The ITV AMERICAN COURAGE lightly allided with the closed bridge causing minor damage to the 02-deck super structure and connected forward awnings of the bridge deck and 02 deck.  The tow face-lines and tow lines snapped causing the tow to continue under the bridge unaccompanied by the ITV.
  
Approximately four minutes the train came across the CSX 14 Mile Bridge while the ITV was up next to the bridge.  The Pilot of the ITV again contacted the bridge tender to notify them that the bridge had closed despite their previous communications and arrangements. The Pilot requested the bridge tender open the bridge so the ITV could pass through, and retrieve its tow, which was now on the North side of the CSX 14 Mile Bridge.  The Bridge Tender opened the bridge, and the ITV was able to capture and reconnect to its tow without further damage/incident.  

The ITV AMERICAN COURAGE reported the incident to the U.S. Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard ordered the ITV to proceed to Blakely shipyard in Mobile, AL for inspection.  CSX personnel inspected the CSX 14 Mile Bridge for operational integrity and attested that the bridge was undamaged and fully operational.

On 8/25/2022, Coast Guard Investigators boarded the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE at Blakely Shipyard and interviewed the operators of the vessel and inspected the damage.  All navigational equipment appeared operational and in good working order.  Damage was noted on the 02 superstructure and bridge awnings.  

CG Investigators then visited CSX personnel at the State Docks Terminal Railway where the Bridge Tender was stationed.  The Bridge Tender stated that after a period of time, they noticed that the expected rail traffic was approaching the open 14-mile bridge and assumed that the bridge would be clear.  The Bridge Tender also stated they made a broadcast on VHF radio that they were was shutting the 14-mile bridge (VHF transcript didn’t indicate a broadcast), and then they began shutting the bridge.  The Bridge Tender stated that visual camera came back online, and they didn’t notice the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE in the bridge opening; however, throughout the incident, the towing vessel or its barges can be seen in at least one of the four cameras at all times.  
The Bridge Tender’s lack of situational awareness of the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE during its crossing into and through the open CSX 14 Mile Bridge and closing the bridge was the primary factor for the reportable casualty.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event of this marine casualty was the allision of the ITV AMERICAN COURAGE with the CSX 14 Mile Bridge. Contributing factors to the casualty include 1) The bridge tenders lack of situational awareness regarding the location ITV AMERICAN COURAGE 2) Oncoming train traffic panicked the Bridge Tender despite the train slowing for the open bridge 3) Bridge Tender’s lack of Automatic Identification System (AIS) functionality to access vessel traffic at the time of the bridge closure 4) The height of the bridge sensors on the river  5) Mechanical error when the Bridge Tender lost satellite communications and ""digi"" communications.",AL,Baldwin County,['MOBILE'],['14 MILE RAILROAD BRIDGE'],"['AEP 7170', 'HB 1602', 'HB 1607', 'HB 1718B', 'HB 1735B', 'ACBL3411', 'ACBL5400', 'AMERICAN COURAGE']","30.83687,-87.9447"

The forward starboard spud of the lead barge in the tow (crane barge) came into contact with maintenance scaffolding on the Tenth Street Wheeling Highway Bridge mile marker (MM) 90.3 on the Ohio River and knocked down scaffolding.

The Master at the time of the incident used only the chart and its vertical clearance when performing the navigational assessment for daily operation. The vertical clearance at the Tenth Street Wheeling Highway Bridge on the chart was 56.2 feet. The barge the spud was sitting on had approximately 3 feet draft, and 6 feet of freeboard. The Master was told that the spuds were stowed with spuds protruding 50 feet from the deck of the barge. He did not know the exact measurements of each spud. The spuds are 64 feet in length and the vertical clearance with the freeboard and spuds combined totaled approximately 55 feet. When the Master completed his navigational assessment the morning of the incident, he did not consult Local Notices to Mariners for the area. Coast Guard District 8 published Local Notice to Mariners (LNM) 11-22 which stated the vertical clearance on the Tenth Street Wheeling Highway Bridge (known locally and in the LNM as Wheeling Suspension Bridge) may be reduced by two feet through June 2023. It was included in their August 3, 2022 LNM 31-22  publication distributed to the D8 maritime community.

Coast Guard Marine Safety Unit (MSU) Pittsburgh distributed a document titled ""Marine Safety Unit Pittsburgh Waterways Information"" at the Waterways Association Pittsburgh meetings held in July and August that state that the Ninth Street Bridge at MM 90.8 on the Ohio River was undergoing maintenance and vertical clearance could be reduced by four (04) inches. The document was distributed to local maritime industry partners at both meetings. The document was not properly edited before it was distributed and listed the wrong bridge, MM, and location and did not mention ongoing work at the Tenth Street Wheeling Highway Bridge at all. The Master of the ROCKET did not consult this document when performing the navigational assessment for the vessel transit on August 10, 2022. Maintenance was being performed at MM .8 at the Ninth Street Bridge on the Allegheny River. MSU Pittsburgh Waterways Division has corrected the document to be distributed to industry to reflect correct mile markers and bridge names per navigational charts and local notices to mariners in effect for the Pittsburgh AOR. 

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision of the starboard forward spud on the crane barge with the scaffolding on the Tenth Street Wheeling Highway Bridge (Wheeling Suspension Bridge). The causal factors that contributed to this casualty are: 1) failure of the Master of the ROCKET to consult LNM when performing the navigational assessment which reduced vertical clearance by two (02) feet, 2) failure of the Master to know the vertical clearance needed for the tow.

Though not a contributing factor to this casualty, this incident identified waterways information handed out to marine industry partners by MSU Pittsburgh was not correct information and could contribute to future marine casualties if the information is in fact used to perform navigational assessments by towing vessel Masters that operate within MSU Pittsburgh AOR.",PA,Westmoreland County,['MONONGAHEL'],['WHEELING SUSPENSION BRIDGE'],"['BHS 09', 'ROCKET']","40.157,-79.89453"
7568076,37.76908,-122.23038,"On June 14, 2022, at approximately 1900 local time, the U.S. flagged towing vessel RIVER CAT (535117) was pushing a barge (DB ALAMEDA) when the crane onboard the barge struck the Fruitvale Railroad Bridge near Alameda, CA.  The crane struck the bridge during transit underneath the bridge, which caused minor damage to the bridge and more significant damage to the crane.  

The master of the towing vessel reported the allision to the U.S. Coast Guard.  Both the master and the deckhand of the RIVER CAT were directed to take Post-casualty DOT drug tests.

As a result of the investigation, the U.S. Coast Guard determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision itself.  Causal factors that contributed to the initiating event were:  Master's Failure To Properly Prepare For Transit; Inadequate Bridge Clearance Communications; and Bridge Operator Failure to Report Available Clearance. 

Enforcement for failing to review Local Notice to Mariners, which listed partial opening of the Fruitvale Railroad Bridge at 80 feet, was considered in this case.  However, the investigation concluded that the master did ask for a full lift at the Miller Sweeny and Fruitvale Railroad Bridge portion of the transit and the bridge operator (who operates both bridges) confirmed a full lift was provided.  The master was not aware of the bridge operator policy to specifically request a lift of the Fruitvale Bridge, which is located in the same vicinity as the Miller Sweeny Vehicle Bridge. While the master should have reviewed Local Notice to Mariners, prior to the transit, the investigation did not conclude that enforcement is warranted; given the circumstances that the master requested a full lift of both bridges and there was a communication breakdown between the bridge operator and master.

Follow-Up Actions:

The Investigating Officer in this case worked with Coast Guard Eleventh District (D11) Bridge Section following this incident.  D11 has initiated a request, through National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to update nautical chart #18649 with the following updated bridge clearance heights:

The NDC 160 was attached to the port side of the KENDALL J HERBERT and the DIDAPPER 78 was attached to the starboard bow of the NDC 160, directly in front of the KENDALL J HERBERT. The tow was underway on the Elizabeth River heading southbound through the Gilmerton Bridge. As the Mate made his approach to the bridge and began making the right-hand turn, the angle and direction of the tow caused the barge NDC 160 to approach the East side of the fender system. The Mate backed the engines down and slowed the tow to .5 knots, but could not avoid hitting the Gilmerton Bridge fender. The NDC 160 allided with the East side of the fendering system causing damage to one rubber fender at an estimated cost of $5,000. The Mate did not report the allision to the Coast Guard because he stated this is the purpose of the fender system. 
  
The tow's allision with a bridge raises the presumption of negligence on the part of the towing vessel operator. Wireless device distraction was ruled out.

As a result of the investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event was the barge's allision with the Gilmerton Bridge. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) Mate's failure to properly align the vessel for maneuvering.

7572710,41.07293,-73.89379,"On October 02, 2022 at approximately 0159 hours, the Towing Vessel SAINT EMILION (O.N. 1216794) was pushing ahead the Tank Barge A-87 (O.N. 1255066) and had transited northbound on the Hudson River enroute to the APEX Terminal in Glenmont, NY.  As the Towing Vessel and Tank Barge approached the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, also known as the Tappan Zee Bridge, near Tarrytown, NY, the Mate, who was on watch in the Pilothouse had nodded off, and the starboard bow of the A-87 Tank Barge allided with the bridge, sustaining significant damage to the forward starboard section of the vessel.  After the allision, the Towing Vessel and Tank Barge anchored approximately one nautical mile north of the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge to conduct a damage assessment.  The crew discovered a hole below the water line of the #1 void space located on the starboard side of the Tank Barge, forward of the collision bulkhead.  The crew opened the cover to the #1 void space and observed that there was water engress and flooding into the space.  The A-87 Tank Barge had a cargo capacity of 80,000 barrels and at the time of the incident the cargo onboard consisted of 25,000 barrels of gasoline and 18,000 barrels of ultra low sulfur heating oil.  The crew transferred the gasoline cargo in the #1 Port and Starboard cargo tanks to the #5 Port and Starboard cargo tanks which prevented further flooding into the #1 void space.  The Towing Vessel and Tank Barge then proceeded to the Center Point Terminal, located in Newark, NJ to discharge its cargo.  After the discharge of cargo was completed, the Tank Barge then proceeded to Clean Waters located in Staten Island, NY, in preparation for hull repairs that took place at the Caddell Dry Dock and Repair Co., Inc., also located in Staten Island, NY.  Sector New York Inspections Division issued a CG-835 to rectify the Tank Barge hull damage deficiency prior to movement.  Repairs to the forward starboard section of the vessel encompassed the main deck, bulwarks, side shell plating, and lower chine bottom plating from centerline to starboard just aft of the vessel's draft markings, and from waterline to main deck.  Furthermore, Poling & Cutler Marine Transportation updated the company's Towing Safety Management System (TSMS) to include two additional navigational requirements which have been implemented fleet-wide.  The first requirement is that when underway, a second person must be on watch in the Pilothouse from 2200 to 0600.  This second person must be on watch in the Pilothouse in addition to the Master from 2200 to 2400 and the Mate from 0000 to 0600.  The second requirement is that when underway, the Bridge Navigational Watch Alarm System (BNWAS), which is the vessel's Pilothouse Alerter System, must be set for no more than 3 minutes.  

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the result of the Mate switching to autopilot then falling asleep in the Pilothouse while on watch as the SAINT EMILION and A-87 approached the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge.  The Mate's inattentiveness negatively impacted the manaueverability and navigation of the Towing Vessel and Tank Barge.  This was followed by the hull damage and flooding of the A-87 Tank Barge.  The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) improper oversight of the Master to implement a Pilothouse lookout, (2) ineffectiveness of the crew to enforce the change of watch procedures, (3) failure of the Mate to follow the company's navigation policy, (4) failure of the Pilothouse Alerter System to activate an alarm, (5) the absence of a qualified lookout, (6) no means to prevent hull failure upon allision with the Governor Mario M.

On 29 August 2022, USCG Sector Lake Michigan (SLM) Command Center (CC) received a notification from the M/V VISTA KING (O.N. 593409), a U.S. Flagged inspected vessel, allided with the Michigan St. Bridge going over the Milwaukee River.  The allision resulted in a minor scuff to the rub rail of the vessel (no CG-835 issued) and no damage sustained by the bridge (as determined by the Milwaukee Department of Public Works).

Normally the Bridge Operators will open the bridges as required upon hearing the security calls from the subject vessel, which are done right after getting underway.  In this situation, the vessel made the normal security call, which the vessel operator assumed the bridge tender would open the bridge, but after a recent fatality on the Milwuakee Bridges system (not related to this casualty), the bridge operators were instructed not to open the bridges until the vessel is right ""on top"" of the bridge.  In this situation, the winds were blowing out of the southwest with an incrreased river current due to recent heavy rains in the area.

7593832,30.06567,-93.34786,"At approx. 2000 on 31OCT22 received report of a bridge allision of the Ellender bridge by the ITV Mr. Landon while the ITV was pushing ahead a crane barge with spuds in excess of 98' in Sulphur, LA. The bridge operator reportedly observed minor damage to the bridge and the ITV is reporting a partially bent pile on spud on the crane barge. No injuries were reported during this incident. The suspected cause of the bridge is reported by Louisiana Department of Transportation (LADOT) to be due to the bridge not being sufficiently elevated as the ITV and Crane Barge transited through the bridge after being raised. 

At approx. 1930 on 31OCT22, the ITV MR. LANDON as lead towing vessel pulling the Spud Barge MIKE H in vicinity of MM 243 struck the Ellender Bridge on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway in Sulphur, Louisiana. The object that struck the Ellender bridge was the port side 100' spud on the Spud Barge Mike H causing an estimated $100,000 of damage to the barge and spud and no nominal reported damage to the bridge. The incident occurred due to the bridge not being elevated to the requested height to accommodate the rising studs on the Stud Barge MIKE H (requested bridge elevation was 120' from the master of the MR. LANDON).The bridge operator was inexperienced with novel defects with the bridge skew and height gauging giving the bridge tender a false impression of the actual and true height of elevation during his implementation of the bridge raising evolution. There were no reported injuries as a result of the allision and no damage to the bridge, allowing for immediate return to normal bridge operations. 

The causal factors that contributed to this casualty were determined to be:

Workplace – Supervision: Lack of adequate training for new bridge operator.

The assigned personnel was working as a Bridge Tender in a temporary relief capacity for Louisiana Department of Transportation. The Louisiana Department of Transportation that oversees bridges in Southwest Louisiana had recently had a severe employee shortfall due to an ongoing internal investigation, degrading the previous reliable manning with staff familiarized with the bridge tending duties, equipment and operations. This inexperienced Bridge Tender, while working in temporary relief capacity, was never given in-person resources to familiarize with bridge tender operations. The bridge tender considered improper gauging readings were accurate and true. It is reasonable to believe that had this employee been given proper supervision from experienced personnel up to and including management of the bridge raising operations, and novel defects, that he would have raised the bridge elevation higher than what the defective gauge was reporting, alleviating the possibility of an allision.

Precondition-Vessel/Facility/Equipment (Hardware)– Condition: Failure to properly calibrate the bridge Height and Skew indicator.

The bridge director for Louisiana Department of Transportation stated that the skew and height indicating gauges are not reporting an accurate measure of the real time elevation of the Ellender bridge when being operated by the bridge tender. The skew and height indicating gauges are required to be calibrated at differing intervals and renewed when needed to ensure proper reporting of elevation above. The bridge operator believed he had the bridge elevated at 125' as indicated on the skew and height indicating gauges, however the elevation was well below 120' as the height of the port spud on the spud barge MIKE H was approximately 120' tall indicated a minimum gauge drift of over 5'. It is reasonable to believe that if the height and skew gauges were calibrated, the bridge operator would have been able to elevate the bridge to requested height on basis of accuracy of height and skew gauges.

Precondition-Mismatch - Between Person and Hardware: Inexperienced Personnel operating as Bridge Tender with known defects.

During an employee shortfall resulting from internal investigations at the Louisiana Department of Transportation, the organization filled in bridge tender vacancies with personnel from different departments. The inexperienced personnel were not familiarized with experiential knowledge of the mechanics and operations of bridge tending duties in conjunction with novel defects on the Ellender Bridge skew and height gauging. It is reasonable to believe that had the organization resourced personnel experienced with bridge tending duties in conjunction with known bridge defects, that the Ellender Bridge allision could have been prevented.

7596032,29.66792,-91.0991,"On November 15, 2022 at approximately 1202 (CST), the towing vessel MR LEON was conducting a northbound transit through the Bayou Beouf pushing ahead two loaded deck barges with a smaller spud boat tied off to it. The vessel was coming from Lake Charles, LA headed to the Ponchartrain Construction facility in Amelia, LA.  While underway, the lead barge of the tow, 525, allided with the Bayou Beouf Railroad Bridge.  The Master, who had transited this area 4 months ago, stated that as he was approaching the bridge, he was unsure of the width of the span and called the bridge tender to request the data.  The width was 56 feet and the tow had a width of 55 feet with the smaller spud boat attached to the tow.  

Even though he only had 1 foot of clearance, the Master decided to attempt to pass through the bridge spans at a slow speed of 1 knot.  His plan was to land the tow on the starboard fender and use the fender as a pivot to get the tow into position.  The small spud boat was the central pivot point and as the tow was pivoting, the lead barge unintentionally made contact with the port fender system.  The damage was minor and consisted of one wooden plank falling out of place.  Throughout this evolution, the Master of the MR LEON employed a lookout on the bow who did not provide any warning of allision until seconds before it occurred.   

When asked why he attempted the transit with the spud boat, which added 20 feet to his tow's width, the Master stated he could not let the boat go on his own and required the operator of the boat to remove it from the tow.  In his words, this was due to ""insurance purposes.”  The voyage plan indicated no knowledge of the bridge's width and the Master seemed to know very little about the characteristics of the bridge, believing that the spans had different maximum passing widths despite the bridge tender saying otherwise

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard has determined the initiating event for this casualty to be the allision with the bridge fender.

7628993,27.81268,-97.39528,"On January 18th, 2023, the vessel agent for the bulk carrier STAR HELENA had arranged for pilotage and a pilot was dispatched to bring the vessel to berth.  Once on board, the pilot got the vessel underway to the ADM dock.  During the transit the master passed vessel information to the pilot which included draft readings. The master reported an air draft of 41.9M and a deep aft draft of 9.8M.  When the pilot heard the air draft readings it was determined that there was not enough air gap to proceed under the Corpus Christi Harbor Bridge because the maximum allowable air draft on a normal day was 42M.  The pilot explained that due to a coastal flood advisory and current tide gauge reading the vessel would make contact with the bridge and the pilot ordered the vessel back to anchorage where it was to conduct de-ballasting operations to reduce the air draft as much as possible.  The pilot also advised the master to request the new pilotage time as near as possible to the next predictable low tide the following day.  

On the day of the incident a new pilot was dispatched to the STAR HELENA and the master reported the air draft at 41.55M with an aft deep draft of 10.25M.  The pilot determined that with a 41.55M air draft and the negative tide reading that the vessel would pass the bridge without incident.  The inbound transit proceeds without issue until the vessel reached the Corpus Christi Harbor Bridge where it made contact with the bridge.  The vessel sustained minor damage which included the INMARSAT C unit and superficial mast damage.  The vessel transited safely to its berth with no further incident.  The INMARSAT C unit was rendered inoperable because of the impact.  The vessel was able to submit a request for a new unit and it was installed prior a scheduled annual FFVE on the 23rd of January. The Pilot reported the incident, no other damage, injuries, or pollution to report.  A survey was done on the bridge immediately following the impact.  There was no damage sustained by the bridge and it remains in use as normal.

As a result of the investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was an allision with the Corpus Christi Harbor Bridge.

The entire tow of 15 barges broke away.  After the breakaway, 4 barges allided with and remained lodged against the L and I Railroad Bridge until removed the following day.  9 barges allided with and remained lodged against the McAlpine Power Plant gates until removed in a multiple day salvage.  8 barges were damaged in the multiple allisions.  The hopper barge B-0763B sank later due to water ingress from damage.  All damaged barges including the B-0763B were repaired and placed back into service.  Damage exists to USACE dam gate components and the vane dike protection cell (aka-CG Light, OHR MM 604.3). A thorough damage survey awaits favorable waterway conditions.

7666427,41.35784,-72.09298,"Sector Long Island Sound Command Center received a report from the U.S. Navy regarding a bridge allision involving the vessel HOS ROSEBUD (1323239). The HOS ROSEBUD was transiting the Thames River outbound from the Navy Sub Base in Groton, CT when the vessel's mast contacted the underside of the raised Thames River AMTRAK railroad bridge. No damage to the bridge was reported; the vessel suffered damage only to the mast and associated equipment.

The HOS ROSEBUD is an inspected offshore supply vessel, under Military Sealift Command contract to the U.S. Navy. It is owned and operated by Hornbeck Offshore Services, LLC of Covington, Louisiana. 

The Thames River AMTRAK railroad bridge is a moveable bridge equipped with a vertical lift mechanism. As per 33 C.F.R. 117.224, the bridge will open on signal to a height of 75 feet above mean high water for all vessel traffic unless a full bridge opening to 135.3 feet above mean high water is requested.

The weather on the morning of April 6, 2023 had fog with visibility of less than 1.4 mile; air temperature 48 degrees F, and calm winds. 

On April 6, 2023 at 7:30 a.m., a Naval Ship Pilot (DoD Employee) boarded the HOS ROSEBUD at the Navy Sub Base pier in Groton, CT, intending to take the vessel outbound via the Thames River, ultimately bound for Norfolk, VA. The Pilot discussed his transit plan with the Master of the vessel. Visibility that morning was approximately 200 yards due to fog. The Pilot requested the air draft for the vessel; the Master produced the Pilot Card which listed the air draft at 20.6 meters (67.8 feet). The Pilot did some quick math and determined the air draft was approximately 68 feet. He told the Master that he would request the Thames River AMTRAK railroad bridge be opened to 90 feet so that he could still see the bridge lights to assist in lining up the ship in the center of the opening. The Master agreed with the plan and began making preparations to get the vessel underway. The Pilot made a telephone call to the Bridge Tender and asked for an opening of 90 feet, and provided an estimated time of request for the opening. As the HOS ROSEBUD got closer to the bridge, the Pilot called the AMTRAK Bridge Tender on VHF Channel 13 and requested an opening for 90 feet. They agreed upon the time of the opening and the HOS ROSEBUD proceeded to make their way toward the bridge. At approximately 8:45 a.m., they passed under the bridge at a speed between 5 to 6 knots when the top of the mast struck the underside of the bridge. After passing through, the Pilot held his position and had the vessel crew perform a quick safety survey. The vessel crew reported the mast was bent aft and some equipment mounted on the mast appeared damaged. The Pilot spoke with the Bridge Tender who reported there was no damage to the bridge. The Pilot proceeded to anchorage off New London and completed the accident notifications.

Upon closer examination, the Pilot Card listed the air draft as 20.6 meters. However, this did not include the height of the mast. The definition of air draft is the measurement from the waterline to the highest point on the vessel. The air draft on the Pilot Card only measured from the waterline to the top of the Pilot House.

As a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this marine casualty was the allision of the HOS ROSEBUD's mast with the underside of the Thames River AMTRAK railroad bridge. The causal factors which contributed to this casualty include: 1) the incorrect listing of the air draft of the HOS ROSEBUD on the Pilot Card; 2) the heavy fog conditions; and 3) the Pilot's request for a less-than-full opening of the bridge.",CT,Southeastern Connecticut Planning Region,['Thames River'],['Amtrak RR Bridge No. 124.09'],['HOS ROSEBUD'],"41.35784,-72.09298"

ODYSSEY III was equipped with masts (forward and aft) that were lowered by an electric motor operated by a button switch in the Pilothouse. Company procedure was for a crewmember to observe the aft mast lower and relay to the pilothouse that the mast is down over a radio. Company procedure to lower the forward mast was to lower it to a point where the Furuno radar is visible through the forward pilothouse window. The observed weather was 77 degrees Fahrenheit, mostly cloudy skies, south winds at 9 miles per hour (MPH), and 10 miles of visibility. Low tide for Potomac River, Washington, DC was 1228 LMT.  ODYSSEY III was underway, northbound, on the Potomac River with 269 passengers onboard, as they approached Long Bridge the master began lowering the forward and aft masts to clear the bridge.

This area is just south of the tri-bridge complex near Morgan City, LA.  As the tow was nearing the intersection, the Berwick Bay Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) watch supervisor noticed the tow in the area, but that it was not displaying an AIS signal.  The watch supervisor and watch stander utilized a video camera to observe the vessel and saw that it was a towing vessel with spud barges. Over the next several minutes, a VTS Berwick Bay watch stander began communicating with the MISS GLENDA. The MISS GLENDA wheelman was asked to provide his air draft.  The wheelman gave various answers, four and six feet, and eventually stated he had four feet of clearance.  The MISS GLENDA was cleared to transit north through the tri-bridge complex based on the information the MISS GLENDA wheelman provided. At approximately 1206, the MISS GLENDA reported to VTS BERWICK BAY that its spud barge was stuck on the Highway 182 Bridge.  The watch stander asked again about the tow’s air draft.  At that time, the wheelman stated 55 feet, which was not the information provided earlier in the transit.  

The MISS GLENDA was less than 26 feet and was not required to have an AIS onboard.  In addition, the wheelman was not required to be a credentialed mariner, and he had never operated a vessel in the Morgan City area before.  The wheelman showed investigators an application on his cell phone that he used for navigation.  When viewing the bridge height information, he wrongly looked at the nominal information for the bridge and not the actual height clearly listed on the display in the application.  Also, the wheelman stated he called a friend to ask about the bridge clearance, but that friend had never operated in the Morgan City area either.  Although the wheelman was in conversation with VTS, he never asked about the bridge height.  

The spud legs on the WLV-3 were bent following the allision with the bridge causing approximately $20,000.00 in damage.  The barge’s spud legs were stuck under the bridge structure for about three to four hours.  The bridge was initially closed to traffic pending a survey, but it was not damaged.  

During the investigation, Coast Guard investigators reviewed the traffic management of the Berwick Bay VTS and found several causal factors that contributed to this incident.  Those are listed below.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event was the allision of the lead spud barge, WLV-3, with the Highway 182 Bridge.  The causal factors that contributed to this incident include:

1. The MISS GLENDA wheelman did not practice good seamanship and operated his vessel in a negligent manner. The wheelman did not use official charts for transiting the area 
On February 4, 2023, at about 12:00 CST, the uninspected towing vessel MISS GLENDA was pushing ahead two spud barges, WLV-3 and Spud Barge 1701, near the intersection of the ICW MM 95 and Atchafalaya River.

During the investigation, Coast Guard investigators reviewed the traffic management of the Berwick Bay VTS and found several causal factors that contributed to this incident.  Those are listed below.

As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined the initiating event was the allision of the lead spud barge, WLV-3, with the Highway 182 Bridge.  The causal factors that contributed to this incident include:

1. The MISS GLENDA wheelman did not practice good seamanship and operated his vessel in a negligent manner. The wheelman did not use official charts for transiting the area and instead utilized a phone application. While using the application, he was not knowledgeable on what information meant in the display.  

2. The MISS GLENDA wheelman was not familiar with the Morgan City area and had never operated a vessel there before. He was accustomed to operating upon the Mississippi River near New Orleans where bridge heights are much higher.  Radio communications revealed the wheelman’s lack of knowledge on navigation requirements for the area.  At times, other vessels directed the wheelman on who to call for assistance and his location.

3. The MISS GLENDA wheelman provided false information regarding his tow characteristics. While in transit, the wheelman called a friend to get bridge height information instead of asking VTS, who he was having an active conversation with, and provided the wrong air draft height several times.  It is not known if the misinformation was intentional or if he did not understand the meaning of air draft. 

4. Prior to reporting for watch, the VTS watch stander was in a fatigued state. The watch stander had just returned from leave in Puerto Rico and drove in from Tampa, FL, the night before. The watch stander stated English is their second language and it was hard to understand radio communications on the day of the incident, especially after being in an area recently where only Spanish was spoken. The watch stander admitted to being “super tired” while on watch. 

5.  The watch stander failed to recognize a developing traffic conflict, failed to recognize obvious inaccurate information regarding air draft, failed to request assistance from the watch supervisor when struggling with tasking, and failed to recognize the MISS GLENDA was not familiar with the area. This may be due to the watch stander’s inability to hear channel 13 communications, inability to process and understand the situation due to fatigue and/or experience, or lack of knowledge/experience. The VTS internal operating procedures requires the watch stander to monitor channels 11 and 13.  The watch stander stated that when listening to channel 11 with a headset on, it is difficult to hear channel 13.  The channel 13 speaker was located away from the watch stander. Therefore, the watch stander did not hear the conversations of the MISS GLENDA wheelman speaking to other vessels, all being conducted on channel 13.

6.  The watch supervisor did not have all information regarding the MISS GLENDA and therefore was unaware of the ongoing issues regarding its transit and vessel characteristics.  
a. The watch supervisor did not hear radio communications on channel 11. The watch supervisor desk has one radio speaker and that was turned to channel 13.  The watch supervisor directed the watch stander on several occasions to obtain information about the MISS GLENDA.  However, since the watch stander was using a headset to listen to channel 11, the watch supervisor could not hear the radio communication.  All calls with VTS were on channel 11.  All calls with other vessels were on channel 13.   
b. The watch supervisor gave direct orders to the watch stander, which were not always immediately followed. The watch supervisor expected that directions to the watch stander were followed and all appropriate information was obtained.  
c. The watch supervisor and watch stander had different experience levels and viewed the traffic situation in the VTS area differently. This led to the watch supervisor’s over reliance on the watch stander’s qualification ability.  The watch stander had only been qualified for six months and felt the traffic in the area at that time was a lot to handle.  
d.  As the situation developed, the watch supervisor was handling another issue on the telephone and was not able to closely follow the situation.

7. The Berwick Bay VTS internal operating procedures did not provide adequate instruction on the watch duties and responsibilities.

Note: Failure to monitor radio communications was a causal factor in a previous incident. On January 14, 2023, the ITV LIBERTY and ITV TEENIE SONIER had a near collision when the TEENIE SONIER failed to give proper clearance to the LIBERTY. Both vessels had a verbal altercation on channel 13 prior to meeting. In that situation, neither the watch stander nor watch supervisor intervened in the situation that was clearly developing by the holding TEENIE SONIER’s refusal to move out of the path of the down bound LIBERTY.  See IIA # 7652464.

The SUSAN K was transiting southbound on the lower Mississippi River, near mile marker 363, pushing 25 loaded barges. At the time of the incident there were 9 persons on board the vessel.

The Master originally intended to pass through the navigable bridge span closer to the right descending bank.  When he found that his vessel was out of position to safely pass through the span closer to the right descending bank, he made the judgement call to pass through the navigable span closer to the left descending bank. He was not successful in passing through the span on the left descending bank and his tow, specifically the SCF 24145B allided with the bridge piling. 

Two other barges were damaged because of the bridge allision. The two other damaged barges were the SCF 11133B and the SCF 14119B. Both the SCF 11133B and the SCF 14119B stayed afloat with the assistance of dewatering equipment. In total, 3 of the 25 barges were damaged and the estimated damages was $550,000.

As a result of its investigation the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was allision between the SUSAN K’s tow and the Natchez/Vidalia Hwy 80 Bridge.

The vessel, CT8712BF, was transiting southbound under the bridge when the crane, which was extended and upright at a 45-degree angle to the deck, struck the underside of the bridge. Bridge Inspectors determined there was no damage to the bridge and it was safe for rail traffic. The crane on the work boat suffered scrapes and a broken hydraulic line which discharged approximately 2 gallons of hydraulic fluid into the Connecticut River.

Prior to the incident, the crew on the work boat had been preparing a swim platform to be delivered to Point-O-Woods Beach in Old Lyme. They were using the deck-mounted crane to work on and place the floating swim platform on the aft deck and secure it for the trip. The crew left the vessel for lunch, and when they returned, they failed to retract the 2 boom extensions prior to getting underway. The vessel needed to transit south through the Old Lyme/Old Saybrook AMTRAK railroad bridge which spans the Connecticut River in order to get to Point-O-Woods Beach.  The clearance with the bridge in the closed position is approximately 18 feet. The Operator on the workboat did not need to request an opening because the air draft of the work boat is approximately 13 feet when the crane is secured and completely retracted. Recent heavy rains caused the Connecticut River to crest over flood stage, resulting in a great deal of large debris floating in the river. The Operator and his crew members were focused on identifying and avoiding floating debris and all failed to notice the crane was extended and upright when the vessel departed the South Yard Marina. As the Operator attempted to transit under the bridge, the crane's boom extension hung up on the underside of the bridge, halting the workboat's forward progress. The Operator immediately reversed engines while a crew member lowered the crane boom. The crew member could not retract the boom extensions because a hydraulic line had been severed when the boom struck the bridge. The vessel safely returned to the South Yard Marina where the crew used sorbent pads to remove the hydraulic oil from the boat's aft deck and the surface of the Connecticut River.

As a result of this investigation, the Coast Guard has determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the allision between the CT8712BF and the AMTRAK railroad bridge over the Connecticut River in Old Lyme. This was followed by a small hydraulic oil discharge caused by a severed hydraulic line on the crane boom.
