3290,7260894,JULIE ANNE Allision,"On July 17, 2021 at approximately 0448 LMT, the uninspected barge ATLAS 3 (O.N. 1269738) allided with the fendering system of the Gilmerton Bridge. The barge was being pushed ahead by the towing vessel JULIE ANNE (O.N. 1182028). The vessels were southbound from Richmond to Luck Stone in Chesapeake, VA. The mate had control of the vessels at the time and as he maneuvered the vessels under the Gilmerton Bridge, the barge was set to the east and the port quarter of the barge allided with the bridge fendering system. Then, as the vessels approached the Luck Stone facility the mate began to moor the barge to a mooring dolphin. The pushing and pulling of the barge on the dolphin caused it to lean over and eventually was submerged under water. There was no damage to the barge or the bridge. The dolphin was damaged and repairs were estimated to be $84,000.

As a result of the incident investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event was the ATLAS THREE alliding with Gilmerton Bridge. This was followed by the eventual damage to the Luck Stone mooring dolphin. The causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) Inexperience of the mate transiting south through the Gilmerton Bridge, (2) Planning error by the mate for his approach to pass through the bridge, and (3) Execution error by the mate while mooring the barge.

Recommend closing this incident investigation activity with a referral to enforcement.","[{'facility_name': 'gilmerton highway bridge', 'facility_type': 'bridge'}, {'facility_name': 'luck stone gilmerton yard', 'facility_type': 'waterfront facility'}]","['1182028', '1269738']","gilmerton highway bridge,luck stone gilmerton yard","julie anne,atlas three",,,36.775168,-76.295038,7260894,2021-07-17
